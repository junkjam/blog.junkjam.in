    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893405/4bdc7c74-4b54-11e6-8489-72c814ebbc59.jpg" width="360" height="600" title="Pre Fall 2016" >
Keeping track of what is in-trend is quite a task and it can be really tough to stay updated with what is on the shop floor. To refresh and pepper your season with the latest collection, here are the freshest Pre-Fall’ 16 collections straight from the runway. The leopard prints and pastel hues are long-gone. It’s time to welcome the belted dresses, nerve-wrecking T-shirt look and denim shorts to stuff your wardrobe for the coming season.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893388/4b54bba4-4b54-11e6-8f93-01ad8b824da8.jpg" width="500" height="650"></p>

<h1>Prep your look for the season:</h1>

<h2>1. Office Casuals</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893389/4b581100-4b54-11e6-9585-d4d5ae1b9a77.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893392/4b5bb97c-4b54-11e6-9f06-4878565ec8cf.jpg" width="360" height="600">
When you’re an office-goer and you have the freedom to wear whatever you want, instead of a professional look you can also opt for an office-casual look. Patchwork jeans or vintage dresses can be a hit as well. We are not hinting at sweaty pants or revealing outfits but have you thought about off-shoulder tops or dresses?
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893391/4b590c9a-4b54-11e6-9350-b9f2c9ede222.jpg">
The off-shoulder trend has fevered at an alarming pace and if you do not like to expose your arms, off-shoulders are at rescue for your arms. If you wish to wear the off-shoulder look at office you can pair the outfit with cigarette pants or pinstripe skirt, tie a bun and handle the corporate world in style.</p>

<h2>2. Party Popper</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893393/4b5d1d4e-4b54-11e6-94dd-af07accee2c4.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893404/4bdaeda0-4b54-11e6-8fc6-f8ba4ec90566.jpg" width="360" height="600">
The belted dresses are perhaps, the first choice for this Pre-Fall. These belted dresses are ultra-flattering on various body types and you can pull them off easily ‘because they’re guaranteed to start a legacy with cohorts admiring your style.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893394/4b8fcdca-4b54-11e6-8f12-75e18ab2d4a3.jpg">
Select a dress that is breeze-friendly and isn’t too sticky considering the weather and to note the style, nothing would exhibit your glowing skin like these belted dresses with a tad bit lower hemline, that’s just about it.</p>

<h2>3. The T-Shirt Look</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893396/4b950038-4b54-11e6-95fb-f837eb72939b.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893397/4b975324-4b54-11e6-8fd4-1e27b266d20c.jpg" width="360" height="600">
Its the Pre-Fall season and all we wish to do is to Baywatch or perhaps, drink margaritas and wear T-shirts, jeans or shorts but if you are in a 9 to 5 job you can’t really live this dream, can you? Me neither. If you are an office goer, T-shirts can be worn just when you get the knack to pull-off the T-Shirt look.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893395/4b93b9ee-4b54-11e6-8a96-469928486e88.jpg">
A cropped T-shirt with a high-waist pencil skirt is a hit. Or a plain T-shirt with a midi-skirt can do wonders for you. Why don’t you pull off this T-shirt look? Stay comfortable yet corporate.</p>

<h2>4. Shorts-in-Style</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893398/4b9a3ce2-4b54-11e6-8ef9-556d9973b4c9.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893402/4bd06a6a-4b54-11e6-9074-8a032b647b57.jpg" width="360" height="300">
Well! Don&rsquo;t you want to pull out those denim shorts hanging in your closet and take to the road in the perfect street style? Yes, it’s August and you’re exactly thinking what we’re thinking. If you are bored to wear the cutoffs with a pretty tank or with a bodysuit, it’s finally time to tick-present on the denim shorts waiting to be worn.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893399/4b9cbe90-4b54-11e6-9776-3dee109b2379.jpg">
Prep-up and play with the wardrobe essentials to pull-off a wonderful look. You can also wear denim shorts with gladiators, a belt bag and tank top or a crop top. It preps up the street style and looks just perfect.</p>

<h2>5. Mix-and-Match</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893400/4bceedf2-4b54-11e6-9d4b-09fbe74319ba.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893403/4bd3e0dc-4b54-11e6-9805-8a22543971cf.jpg" width="360" height="600">
It&rsquo;s time to mix and match bright and shiny hues like lemon yellow, cherry red, emerald green as it pepper up the entire outfit and makes one look, attractive and pretty. Just in case you fear bright hues, you have no idea how the mix-and-match can swing your entire attire into an exceptionally striking one. What say?
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893401/4bd023f2-4b54-11e6-9463-c948426a0a4a.jpg">
Lemon yellow shirt dress prepped up with gold accessories or an emerald green with brown knee-length boots would surely steal many glances around.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893390/4b58e2e2-4b54-11e6-9689-af80213e9e63.jpg">
The Pre Fall &lsquo;16 collection is all about mixing and matching the bright hues and staying comfortable in whatever you wear. Because experimenting with style and trying out new looks is just so fashionista-type. Try out these looks and all eyes will be on you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888349/1736ff64-4afd-11e6-8aaa-b3da677736d8.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="Street Market New Delhi" >
Everyone complains that Delhi is too costly but is it?? Really? The answer is no, it’s not!! If Delhi has luxurious Malls, best of restaurants then at the same time it also has some amazing street food and street shopping which starts from just Rs.10. So, if you are in Delhi and thinking of shopping at affordable rates, then below is a quick list of Delhi’s Best Street Markets for Girls Shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Janpath:</h2>

<p>This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888351/1738fb2a-4afd-11e6-8b4e-a1a91aef5e7e.jpg">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg"></p>

<h2>2. Sarojini Nagar Market:</h2>

<p>Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888352/173d385c-4afd-11e6-9a19-467482439fb5.jpg" width="500" height="650"></p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888353/173e70b4-4afd-11e6-9ef9-0920aa6a1e84.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888354/17516e9e-4afd-11e6-89ac-a0fd55d02e76.jpg" width="600" height="650"></p>

<h2>3. Chandni Chowk:</h2>

<p>One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-15T23:05:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://blog.junkjam.in/2016/07/15/famous-new-market-in-kolkata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883036/a3765876-4adf-11e6-9615-53bc16f73f84.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="New Market Kolkata" >
Kolkata is the city of joy, where we find many shopping markets to fulfill our shopping needs. This crowded city provides us with many markets like New Market, Gariahat market, Chandni Market etc. In this blog post, we are going to explore in detail about New Market in Kolkata. This market stands on Lindsey Street and was established as a rich arcade to fulfill the shopping requirements of the British-colonist population of the city. As soon as it was opened at the beginning of 1874, it started attracting people from all over India, who spent money in the exclusive shops of this market.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once, British departed this country, New Market had become Indianised. However, its red-brick, ornate exterior still remains British-looking. Its compact clock tower, which rises from its eastern wall, makes us remember the British Empire era.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg"></p>

<p>Inside of New Market you will find a shopping market named S. S. Hawg Market which looks very tangled, however it contains a grid of narrow alleys which are bisecting one another and so many shops and stalls are arranged in neat blocks. You will always find this market busy and crowded and whenever you come at this place, you will find it architecturally chaotic. The boundaries of the market are complicated for defining since it has a basement also, likewise overcrowded with retailers, whose far end seems emerging in another building which contains many more floors of shops. Additionally, of course, the vendors scatter outside the main building and sell their products on the surrounding streets also._</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg"></p>

<p>We need not to say that you can but absolutely everything here you want. Be it grocery item, fruit and vegetable, meat, fish, toys, toiletries, cosmetics, wigs, sandals, shoes, flowers, electric appliances, kitchen utensils, crockery, crystal, silverware, jewelry, dresses, wallets, bags, scarves, shawls, or suitcases, you can find everything in this incredible street market of Kolkata. Even, you will see astrologer, money-changer and barber shops also in this market.
Well, if you are a bag lover and you are on the search for a handbag in this market, you will get completely confused and will be spoilt for choice, as you will find a million bags on sale here in this great street market.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg"></p>

<p>Entering New Market, you can see not only Indians but also the foreigners who visit this market for shopping regularly. Not only street products, you will find every brand’s outlet in this market, whether it is of dresses or of shoes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg"></p>

<p>New Market is not only tourist-friendly; but also the place of foodies as well. Undoubtedly, this place contains the modern shopping malls where you can find top-notch quality products anytime. In a nutshell, this is the place where you can spend your complete weekend, if you are shopaholic and foodie person.</p>

    <id>http://blog.junkjam.in/2016/06/25/fashion-trends-in-du-that-will-rule-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354448/ef0dd216-3ab1-11e6-8ff2-6c7b311dce38.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="DU Fashion Trends" >
As the new academic session begins, all are busy preparing for their first day of college. Where grooming and fashion is indeed a favourite pass time for all women, Delhi University freshers, as we expect, are all busy in rumbling through their closet to choose their trendiest garments. Market places like Sarojini Nagar, Janpath, lajpat are packed these days with “fuchchas” busy increasing their range of clothes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Delhi University is a dream place for everyone and is known for its trend setting fashion statement. Be it hairstyle, dress, bag, gadgets, shoes or accessories, students will always have something to make heads turn.
Denims and dresses, skirts and shorts, classy chappals, casual flip flops, cool shades and bright bags, remain all time summer favourite for college goers.
DU campus guys, to look outstanding, people usually tattoo on their arms and forehand whereas girls probable choice is back, belly, ankle or foot.</p>

<p>2015 had a lot of fashion hits and these hits are surely coming back. Majority of the trends were inspired from runway shows. In case you’re wondering what would happen this year, just keep reading</p>

<h2>1. Off- Shoulders</h2>

<p>Last year it was really difficult to find an off shoulder dress/top. But since they are coming back this year, the market is going to be full of off-shoulder tops and dresses. They have a bohemian vibe in them. This summer I suggest you to go for off-shoulders instead of crop tops.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg"></p>

<h2>2. Trench Coats</h2>

<p>Definitely the best clothing item for winters. Keeps you warm and looks extremely classy. Forever 21 has one of the best trench coat stock. Instead of going for chunky sweaters, go for trench coats or over sized coats.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg"></p>

<h2>3. Bomber and biker jackets</h2>

<p>I mean just have a look at the pictures.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg"></p>

<h2>4. Ripped Jeans</h2>

<p>When girls came across ripped jeans, they started to hate their normal boring jeans. This year too, they are going to rule. In fact, these jeans cost more than normal jeans.So, I suggest you to DIY your old jeans. It’s pretty simple!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg"></p>

<h2>5. Trimmed Beards</h2>

<p>I know many boys love big beards, but 2016 is not about that. Keeping it neat and classy is the key.Celebrities like Adam Levine and Liam Hemsworth often rock this look and it is sure to be a hit coming seasons.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg"></p>

<h2>6. Strappy Heels and Lug Sole</h2>

<p>Strappy heels are surely sexier than normal pumps / heels. Some day if you feel your outfit is not popping,
Answer?
Strappy heels.
They are not going anywhere till a better type of heel comes into fashion.
Lug soles have this fashion blogger feel in them, making them one of the biggest trends of 2016.Plus they are very comfortable so it’s a win win for everyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg"></p>

<h2>7. Denim on Denim</h2>

<p>If you were doing the denim on denim trend in 2015, then my friend you were doing it right.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg"></p>

<h2>8. Baggy Trousers</h2>

<p>They are replacing straight-legged or skinny cuts this winter because they create a whole new silhouette.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg"></p>

<h2>9. Must Have Accessories</h2>

<p>Hoop earrings (you can wear them with literally anything!), reflector aviators /sunglasses and totes are coming back in 2016 with a bang!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354480/fe455000-3ab2-11e6-8f60-191239f3e4dc.jpg"></p>

<h2>10. Dip DYE, Bronze and Rainbow Hair</h2>

<p>Girls, it’s time to say goodbye to your blonde streaks because 2016 is not at all about that. Dip-dye, ronze (perfect colour for brunettes) and rainbow hair are the most preferred hair colours by Hollywood celebrities. Go fun or go home.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354482/fe46bbde-3ab2-11e6-8f46-5c8362760270.jpg"></p>

<p>2016 will be all about looking different and stylish. So, which of the above trend will you guys rock?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490335/acd92a9e-2184-11e6-9545-6b028dba05ba.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="Lajpat Nagar Market" >
Among the important shopping areas of Delhi, Lajpat Nagar enjoys a prestigious position because of its locational advantage. A large number of people from all directions of Delhi City come for shopping at Lajpat Nagar, which offers good shopping opportunities and entertainment.</p>

<p>Lajpat Nagar is named after the freedom fighter, Lala Lajpat Rai, known as Punjab Kesari or Lion of Punjab. It is now divided into four parts. Lajpat Nagar I has car accessories and clothing stores, Lajpat Nagar II has the Central Market, local restaurants and home décor units, Lajpat Nagar III has the TDI Mall which houses the 3Cs Cineplex, and food outlets like Sagar Ratna, Chopsticks Express, McDonalds, The Street Foods of India and The Bakers Street while Lajpat Nagar IV, which houses the Amar Colony has a huge ladies.
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490225/ed1d5496-2183-11e6-9da2-631446d7423f.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<p>There is plenty to choose from in terms of bed linen, curtains, table cloth, bath mats, shower curtains and a number of other furnishings that bring warmth to a home. Just land up here and look around to find unique gifts for loved ones, dry fruits, tailors who will alter, stitch and dye clothes, stationery for the kids and so on. Unless there is a fixed price sign prominently displayed in the shop, you should surely bargain for better prices and deals everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a rich variety of cheaply priced curios sold on the streets as well. For instance, old and used wine and perfume bottles in the most interesting colors and shapes; ceramic pots and urns; plastic flowers and beaded curtains… it is purchase of such things in an unplanned, impulsive shopping spree that can either brighten up your day or fill your shopping bags with clutter. So be alert and use your discretion.</p>

<h1>How to Reach the Market:</h1>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490229/f269dc30-2183-11e6-96b5-db26f2d50e5d.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<p>There is no problem that how to reach Lajpat Nagar their is the bus service of Delhi Transport Corporation as well as the Delhi Mass Rapid Transit System has provided very well connection to Lajpat Nagar. East Delhi Anand Vihar and Lajpat Nagar are connected by Route no. 543, Lajpat Nagar and North (Rohini) and West Delhi Punjabi Bagh is connected by Teevr Mudrika. The Delhi Metro Station named Lajpat Nagar is the elevated metro station that is on violet line of Metro that is being situated between Moolchand and Jangpura stations. This station was the first violet line station that was opened for public. So how to reach Lajpat Nagar is not a big issue now.

<h2>Jewellery Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>Central Market in Lajpat Nagar is a crowded market with numerous lanes, selling ready-made wear, saris, night suits, home textiles, crockery, jewellery and much more. In one of the lanes you will find costume jewellery, ranging from small earrings and jhumkas (chandelier-style danglers) to traditional wedding sets – Thses are ,ofcourse ,all replicas. The bangles are the biggest attraction here. You can get different colors and types of bangles: silver, glass, lacquer, white metal, oxidized silver and plastic. Some of them sport gold, silver, color paint and glass work in intricate patterns. You can match them with necklaces and earrings, even when they are not part of a set. The salesmen are most patient, experienced and updated on modern fashion – they even anticipate your needs. However , you have to be alert and bargain hard as well. The shopkeepers here are willing to bring down the prices substantially,so it is surely worthwhile to bargain. Choodas and kalire for the brides are also available.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Salwar Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>This lane is parallel to the front row of shops that is opposite to 3Cs Cineplex. The market is perpetually busy and sells stitched and unstitched salwar suits in all kinds of fabrics. The shops stock salwar suits made of cotton, crepe, georgette and other materials. Some have embroidery or simple patterns on them. These suits are good for regular, casual wear, while some do lend themselves to party-wear as well. The patterns are always new and change rapidly. There are tailors and dye shops very close by, which makes it extremely convenient for shoppers to get white dupattas or salwars dyed to the exact shade. This is done in a couple of hours. The tailors do picoting (edging with loop stitches) on dupattas in a matter of minutes. Most salwar-kameez-dupatta sets are priced Rs. 600 plus, but if the fabric used is of superior quality and has intricate work, they can cost upwards of Rs. 1,000 per set. It is worth bargaining here especially if you are buying more than one salwar set.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jooti Stalls</h2>

<p>Since the branding was a tad questionable, we’re calling them the triad of shoe stores. Bang opposite KFC, stalls number 12, 13, and 14 are Lajpat Nagar’s hotspot for juttis, kohlapuris and other Indian inspired flats for men, women, and children. The stalls offer more or less the same in terms of design {thread work, cutout, solid colours, and embellishments}, styles, and price ranges. There does exist a certain competitive streak between the three stores, so if you’re in the mood for some theatrics, you can feign disinterest in one, to get yourself a better rate at the next one.</p>

    <updated>2016-04-24T16:53:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://blog.junkjam.in/2016/04/24/gk-m-block-market-new-delhi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
Since the 1970s, the Greater Kailash M-Block Market, known locally just as &rsquo;M-block market', has attracted Delhi&rsquo;s upwardly mobile. Positioned side-by-side along a covered walking path, stall vendors flog all sort of knickknacks, making for a colorful afternoon wander.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Greater Kailash’s M Block Market is synonymous with ‘lifestyle’, with its fashion, accessories and cosmetics shops along with outlets of popular international brands.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything from groceries to fast fashion, as well as international street/sport brands such as Puma and Lacoste. But the tip for shopping here is to look beyond the immediately obvious stores to more unusual outlets, such as Tantra Boutique, a great place to snap up a new sari.</p>

<p>A two-part up market is best known for the mother of Fabindia.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
M Block is popular both with the young and the not-so-young who throng the chaat (Indian spicy fast-snack, typically sold at street corners) kiosks and the retail outlets. It has international brands like Benetton, Esprit, Reebok, Giovanni and Sisley. L’Affaire is a local favorite for a sophisticated line of Indian ethnic wear.</p>

<p>Shops that sell gold, silver and diamond ornaments including Orra and De Beers for contemporary designs and Hazoorilal and Rakyan for traditional jewelery are found here.</p>

<p>Many outlets sell western wear and accessories like bags, shoes and scarves. This market is also famous for the pavement vendors who sell tops, cardigans, track suits and other garments which are very much in tune with latest trends at affordable prices.</p>

<p>If you go out for an evening stroll around this market, chances are you will end up buying things – a pair of gloves, stockings, lingerie, cosmetics, silver trinkets, clothes for the kids</p>

<p>The lane behind the market is home to several ladies’ tailors. You can buy ready-to-wear saree blouses or get them stitched.</p>

<p>None of the hustle bustle seen in M Block is seen in the N-Block market next door. A host of retail garment stores, such as Cottons, Kilol and FabIndia do brisk business. FabIndia, Apartment 9, and Episode are niche stores.</p>

<p>The Archana Shopping Complex just opposite to the N block shopping market has some exclusive and affordable boutiques that sell Indian wear and jewelery.</p>

<h1>How to reach the Market:</h1>

<p>The market is easily accessible by local transport within the city and is located near Nehru Place, one of the well known commercial hubs in South Delhi. Most shoppers prefer to get dropped off just outside the market to avoid looking for parking in the scarce space available. You can choose to drive down, hail a cab, take the metro (Kailash colony station and take an auto rickshaw from there to the market) or take an auto rickshaw/cab from anywhere in Delhi to the market.</p>

<h1>Don&rsquo;t Miss</h1>

<ol>
<li>Brown Sugar Sandwiches
 For a more serious hunger pang, head to Brown Sugar and enjoy their wide range of sandwiches in various kinds of breads that, true to their tagline, are sure to get you addicted!

<li>Mahesh Chaat Bhandar
 Ever since they made it to the Kapoor wedding, Dilliwalas love to queue up for the golgappas at this tiny shop. Waiting in the queue you may hear “the prices are astronomical” or “are all of these people really waiting for chaat??” However living in Delhi, I have come to love this place</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sarojini Nagar Market (SN Market) is one of the most coveted markets of Delhi NCR. It has been North Capital Region’s most favourable shopping destination at killer prices. Sarojini Nagar has never been a disappointment whether one has to buy shoes, trendy clothes, fashionable jewellery or designer bags. And of course, there is no use of shopping without a healthy bargain dose.

<p>SN is listed as an ultimate destination for street fashion at cheap rates. There has been a wide range of high-street merchandise available, be it fashion designers, starlets, college students, school going kids, hard working professionals etc. The buyers here are not affected by the weather conditions. Even in summers, when the sun seems especially strong, all the streets of the market are bustling and being elbowed.</p>

<p>All regular shoppers had some advice that sprung from years of experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, you must withdraw enough money before entering the market as the ATMs have long queues.</li>
<li>You must remember to carry a king sized bag to stow your shopping, as carrying small polythene bags will not be handy enough and it might become a task to carry so many bags.</li>
<li>You must have the quality to bargain and never ask for price. You call out the price you want to pay and walk away if the seller does not agree to your price. Nine out of ten times the vendor will follow you and will give you the thing at your price.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some crazy and unbelievable facts about Sarojini Nagar:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the only market where one can get the most expensive brands at one-fourth of its original price, be it Vero Moda, Lacoste, Zara, Mango or any other brand.</li>
<li>SN market is the best place to get a mind boggling variety of styles, panaches, etc. This gives you the latest trends of fashion.</li>
<li>It is the best place to check how good you are at bargaining.</li>
<li>You’ll find ample variety of shoes available all across the lanes and by-lanes of the market at astounding rates.</li>
<li>If you’re jewellery junky, then Sarojini can prove to be the most lucrative destinations.</li>
<li>The best time to shop at Sarojini is a weekday. You will not miss out on fresh stocks.</li>
<li>Wait! If you’re tired after doing all the shopping and you feel hungry, you need to worry as you’ll find great food out there in the market.</li>
</ul>
