    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798143/745a2a54-65ec-11e6-90c2-0acac849f0e1.jpg" width="500" height="400" title="High neck blouse" >
Denim is a kind of cotton material known for its utilization in pants and other garments. It utilizes a solid twill weave with a trademark corner to corner ribbing. Initially utilized for laborers' garments, denim is presently pervasive and has even entered the universe of high form. About everybody has no less than one article of clothing made of this fabric in the storage room nowadays.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Style today is deficient without denim. Denim comes in all structures, looks and washes to coordinate with each dress. It is hard to trust that the same denim was initially utilized in dress for the jeans and overalls worn by mineworkers on the west coast (US).</p>

<h2>1.  Dry Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798142/744c4498-65ec-11e6-92c4-ee368d33df10.jpg">
Dry or crude denim, rather than washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed in the wake of being colored amid its creation. Most denim is washed subsequent to being made into a piece of attire. It is done so keeping in mind the end goal to make it milder and to wipe out any shrinkage which could bring about a thing to not fit after the proprietor washes it. Notwithstanding being washed, non-dry denim is some of the time falsely distressed to accomplish a well-used in look.</p>

<h2>2.  Selvage Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798143/745a2a54-65ec-11e6-90c2-0acac849f0e1.jpg">
Selvage denim is a sort of denim which frames a spotless normal edge that does not unwind. It is ordinarily introduced in the unwashed or crude state. Normally, the selvage edges will be situated along the out crease of the jeans, making it unmistakable when sleeves are worn. Despite the fact that selvage denim is not totally synonymous with unwashed denim, the nearness of selvage commonly suggests that the denim utilized is of a higher quality.</p>

<h2>3.  Stretch Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798146/7460792c-65ec-11e6-879d-08611058cb2f.jpg">
It is more often around 98% cotton and 2% Spandex for a touch of that easy-going stretch that we as a whole love. This mix gives you awesome simplicity and in the meantime some backing for those inconvenient spots you aren&rsquo;t so partial to like around the hips or thighs. Stretch denim pants are one of the quickest developing sections of the ladies' business sector for pants makers.</p>

<h2>4.  Poly Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798145/746041f0-65ec-11e6-9136-e3a3d652c623.jpg">
These mixes engage the individuals who like the look of denim yet favor polyester mixes that wash and dry rapidly and are lighter in weight and somewhat dressier. These for the most part speak to a somewhat more established business sector, but on the other hand are discovering support as pant suits when the look is intended to be dressy yet easygoing.</p>

<h2>5.  Ramie Cotton Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798144/745e09c6-65ec-11e6-8d06-cb290d9bf091.jpg">
Ramie cotton denims are found in an assortment of mixes, with a wide value fluctuation. Ramie is a plant fiber more often than not included in light of the fact that it decreases wrinkling and adds a smooth radiance to the fabric. It isn&rsquo;t as solid as cotton and this is the main reason that it must be mixed with this more grounded material so as to stand up as a denim material.</p>

I used to think button ups were excessively proficient search for a general mother like me, yet they&rsquo;re truly a staple that each lady needs in her wardrobe. They come in a wide range of hues and materials; however a great white button up top and lightweight denim is truly the main thing that you require. They are awesome for layering under a sweater, wearing open over a dress, tied at the midsection, tucked into a skirt, or just without anyone else&rsquo;s input with a couple of pants.</p>

dungarees to make for some serious power dressing. Wear them over a crisp white shirt,

Scarves, jackets, shrugs and even overcoats – dungarees go well with each of the layers,
thereby, giving your look an all new edge. For a casual event, wrap a statement contrast
scarf around your neck and style your hair into a high-rise messy bun. For a formal event, on
the other hand, simply rest your jacket or overcoat on your shoulders and opt for pointy
heels to complete the look.</p>

<p>No longer tricky, are they? Rush now, flaunt your love for dungarees by incorporating trendy
accessories to team them up with, and leave a long-lasting impression on your onlookers.</p>

What is the greatest highlight of Delhi shopping? Many may answer, that shopping in the cosmopolitan Delhi malls has revolutionized the shopping experience. But the hidden truth is different. Though the city malls are quite attractive but in comparison to the charm and attraction of the Delhi street markets, it’s nothing. The most convenient proof of the statement is the overcrowded; jam packed areas of the age old traditional markets of Delhi throughout the year.
One of such a traditional market is the Tibetan Market located on the western side of Janpath.  From designer clothing to stylish accessories, home décor to Tibetan artifacts, footwear to woolen clothes get it all in best quality and that too in throw back prices. Seems unbelievable? Well not, the market is one of the most preferred shopping destinations in the capital city.</p>

Originally the place was designed to house in Tibetan refugees in 1960. But what initiated as a small locality dedicated to the fugitives soon got transferred into one of the popular shopping locations of the city. It is the rising fame of the market with its cheap price and quality products that it soon became a tourist spot in Delhi and became christened with the name, the Monastery market.

<p>Another amazing shopping area in Mumbai is the famous Fashion Street, which perfectly fits its name. Here, you will find all the latest fashion clothes, accessories, cosmetics, and much more at affordable prices. These also include first copies of popular brands. Situated in South Mumbai, this street is a cluster of about 385 street side clothing shops placed on MG Road near Azad Maidan, opposite to Bombay Gymkhana. Along with being a favorite shopping street of the locals as well as the visitors, it is also a popular tourist destination located opposite to VSNL office building at MG Road. As we know, the more you bargain, the better price you fetch for particular apparel, so another advantage of shopping here is that it is well known for bargaining. Not only this, but in order to show concern for environment, in January 2011, as a part of green drive of BMC in collaboration with Fashion Street Shop Owners’ Association, the market at Fashion Street banned the use of plastic bags and polybags, and started using paper bags, made by the training workshop of the National Association of the Blind.

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893388/4b54bba4-4b54-11e6-8f93-01ad8b824da8.jpg" width="500" height="650"></p>

<h1>Prep your look for the season:</h1>

<h2>1. Office Casuals</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893389/4b581100-4b54-11e6-9585-d4d5ae1b9a77.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893392/4b5bb97c-4b54-11e6-9f06-4878565ec8cf.jpg" width="360" height="600">
When you’re an office-goer and you have the freedom to wear whatever you want, instead of a professional look you can also opt for an office-casual look. Patchwork jeans or vintage dresses can be a hit as well. We are not hinting at sweaty pants or revealing outfits but have you thought about off-shoulder tops or dresses?
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893391/4b590c9a-4b54-11e6-9350-b9f2c9ede222.jpg">
The off-shoulder trend has fevered at an alarming pace and if you do not like to expose your arms, off-shoulders are at rescue for your arms. If you wish to wear the off-shoulder look at office you can pair the outfit with cigarette pants or pinstripe skirt, tie a bun and handle the corporate world in style.</p>

<h2>2. Party Popper</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893393/4b5d1d4e-4b54-11e6-94dd-af07accee2c4.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893404/4bdaeda0-4b54-11e6-8fc6-f8ba4ec90566.jpg" width="360" height="600">
The belted dresses are perhaps, the first choice for this Pre-Fall. These belted dresses are ultra-flattering on various body types and you can pull them off easily ‘because they’re guaranteed to start a legacy with cohorts admiring your style.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893394/4b8fcdca-4b54-11e6-8f12-75e18ab2d4a3.jpg">
Select a dress that is breeze-friendly and isn’t too sticky considering the weather and to note the style, nothing would exhibit your glowing skin like these belted dresses with a tad bit lower hemline, that’s just about it.</p>

<h2>3. The T-Shirt Look</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893396/4b950038-4b54-11e6-95fb-f837eb72939b.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893397/4b975324-4b54-11e6-8fd4-1e27b266d20c.jpg" width="360" height="600">
Its the Pre-Fall season and all we wish to do is to Baywatch or perhaps, drink margaritas and wear T-shirts, jeans or shorts but if you are in a 9 to 5 job you can’t really live this dream, can you? Me neither. If you are an office goer, T-shirts can be worn just when you get the knack to pull-off the T-Shirt look.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893395/4b93b9ee-4b54-11e6-8a96-469928486e88.jpg">

Everyone complains that Delhi is too costly but is it?? Really? The answer is no, it’s not!! If Delhi has luxurious Malls, best of restaurants then at the same time it also has some amazing street food and street shopping which starts from just Rs.10. So, if you are in Delhi and thinking of shopping at affordable rates, then below is a quick list of Delhi’s Best Street Markets for Girls Shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Janpath:</h2>

<p>This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888351/1738fb2a-4afd-11e6-8b4e-a1a91aef5e7e.jpg">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg"></p>

<h2>2. Sarojini Nagar Market:</h2>

<p>Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.</p>

<h2>3. Chandni Chowk:</h2>

<p>One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883036/a3765876-4adf-11e6-9615-53bc16f73f84.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="New Market Kolkata" >
Kolkata is the city of joy, where we find many shopping markets to fulfill our shopping needs. This crowded city provides us with many markets like New Market, Gariahat market, Chandni Market etc. In this blog post, we are going to explore in detail about New Market in Kolkata. This market stands on Lindsey Street and was established as a rich arcade to fulfill the shopping requirements of the British-colonist population of the city. As soon as it was opened at the beginning of 1874, it started attracting people from all over India, who spent money in the exclusive shops of this market.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once, British departed this country, New Market had become Indianised. However, its red-brick, ornate exterior still remains British-looking. Its compact clock tower, which rises from its eastern wall, makes us remember the British Empire era.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg"></p>

<p>Inside of New Market you will find a shopping market named S. S. Hawg Market which looks very tangled, however it contains a grid of narrow alleys which are bisecting one another and so many shops and stalls are arranged in neat blocks. You will always find this market busy and crowded and whenever you come at this place, you will find it architecturally chaotic. The boundaries of the market are complicated for defining since it has a basement also, likewise overcrowded with retailers, whose far end seems emerging in another building which contains many more floors of shops. Additionally, of course, the vendors scatter outside the main building and sell their products on the surrounding streets also._</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg"></p>

<p>We need not to say that you can but absolutely everything here you want. Be it grocery item, fruit and vegetable, meat, fish, toys, toiletries, cosmetics, wigs, sandals, shoes, flowers, electric appliances, kitchen utensils, crockery, crystal, silverware, jewelry, dresses, wallets, bags, scarves, shawls, or suitcases, you can find everything in this incredible street market of Kolkata. Even, you will see astrologer, money-changer and barber shops also in this market.
Well, if you are a bag lover and you are on the search for a handbag in this market, you will get completely confused and will be spoilt for choice, as you will find a million bags on sale here in this great street market.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg"></p>

<p>Entering New Market, you can see not only Indians but also the foreigners who visit this market for shopping regularly. Not only street products, you will find every brand’s outlet in this market, whether it is of dresses or of shoes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg"></p>

<p>New Market is not only tourist-friendly; but also the place of foodies as well. Undoubtedly, this place contains the modern shopping malls where you can find top-notch quality products anytime. In a nutshell, this is the place where you can spend your complete weekend, if you are shopaholic and foodie person.</p>

<p>Delhi University is a dream place for everyone and is known for its trend setting fashion statement. Be it hairstyle, dress, bag, gadgets, shoes or accessories, students will always have something to make heads turn.
Denims and dresses, skirts and shorts, classy chappals, casual flip flops, cool shades and bright bags, remain all time summer favourite for college goers.
DU campus guys, to look outstanding, people usually tattoo on their arms and forehand whereas girls probable choice is back, belly, ankle or foot.</p>

<p>2015 had a lot of fashion hits and these hits are surely coming back. Majority of the trends were inspired from runway shows. In case you’re wondering what would happen this year, just keep reading</p>

<h2>1. Off- Shoulders</h2>

<p>Last year it was really difficult to find an off shoulder dress/top. But since they are coming back this year, the market is going to be full of off-shoulder tops and dresses. They have a bohemian vibe in them. This summer I suggest you to go for off-shoulders instead of crop tops.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg"></p>

<h2>2. Trench Coats</h2>

<p>Definitely the best clothing item for winters. Keeps you warm and looks extremely classy. Forever 21 has one of the best trench coat stock. Instead of going for chunky sweaters, go for trench coats or over sized coats.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg"></p>

<h2>3. Bomber and biker jackets</h2>

<p>I mean just have a look at the pictures.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg"></p>

<h2>4. Ripped Jeans</h2>

<p>When girls came across ripped jeans, they started to hate their normal boring jeans. This year too, they are going to rule. In fact, these jeans cost more than normal jeans.So, I suggest you to DIY your old jeans. It’s pretty simple!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg"></p>

<h2>5. Trimmed Beards</h2>

<p>I know many boys love big beards, but 2016 is not about that. Keeping it neat and classy is the key.Celebrities like Adam Levine and Liam Hemsworth often rock this look and it is sure to be a hit coming seasons.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg"></p>

<h2>6. Strappy Heels and Lug Sole</h2>

<p>Strappy heels are surely sexier than normal pumps / heels. Some day if you feel your outfit is not popping,
Answer?
Strappy heels.
They are not going anywhere till a better type of heel comes into fashion.
Lug soles have this fashion blogger feel in them, making them one of the biggest trends of 2016.Plus they are very comfortable so it’s a win win for everyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg"></p>

<h2>7. Denim on Denim</h2>

<p>If you were doing the denim on denim trend in 2015, then my friend you were doing it right.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg"></p>

<h2>8. Baggy Trousers</h2>

<p>They are replacing straight-legged or skinny cuts this winter because they create a whole new silhouette.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg"></p>

<h2>9. Must Have Accessories</h2>

<p>Hoop earrings (you can wear them with literally anything!), reflector aviators /sunglasses and totes are coming back in 2016 with a bang!</p>

<h2>10. Dip DYE, Bronze and Rainbow Hair</h2>

<p>Girls, it’s time to say goodbye to your blonde streaks because 2016 is not at all about that. Dip-dye, ronze (perfect colour for brunettes) and rainbow hair are the most preferred hair colours by Hollywood celebrities. Go fun or go home.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354482/fe46bbde-3ab2-11e6-8f46-5c8362760270.jpg"></p>

<h2>Jewellery Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>Central Market in Lajpat Nagar is a crowded market with numerous lanes, selling ready-made wear, saris, night suits, home textiles, crockery, jewellery and much more. In one of the lanes you will find costume jewellery, ranging from small earrings and jhumkas (chandelier-style danglers) to traditional wedding sets – Thses are ,ofcourse ,all replicas. The bangles are the biggest attraction here. You can get different colors and types of bangles: silver, glass, lacquer, white metal, oxidized silver and plastic. Some of them sport gold, silver, color paint and glass work in intricate patterns. You can match them with necklaces and earrings, even when they are not part of a set. The salesmen are most patient, experienced and updated on modern fashion – they even anticipate your needs. However , you have to be alert and bargain hard as well. The shopkeepers here are willing to bring down the prices substantially,so it is surely worthwhile to bargain. Choodas and kalire for the brides are also available.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Salwar Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>This lane is parallel to the front row of shops that is opposite to 3Cs Cineplex. The market is perpetually busy and sells stitched and unstitched salwar suits in all kinds of fabrics. The shops stock salwar suits made of cotton, crepe, georgette and other materials. Some have embroidery or simple patterns on them. These suits are good for regular, casual wear, while some do lend themselves to party-wear as well. The patterns are always new and change rapidly. There are tailors and dye shops very close by, which makes it extremely convenient for shoppers to get white dupattas or salwars dyed to the exact shade. This is done in a couple of hours. The tailors do picoting (edging with loop stitches) on dupattas in a matter of minutes. Most salwar-kameez-dupatta sets are priced Rs. 600 plus, but if the fabric used is of superior quality and has intricate work, they can cost upwards of Rs. 1,000 per set. It is worth bargaining here especially if you are buying more than one salwar set.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jooti Stalls</h2>

<p>Since the branding was a tad questionable, we’re calling them the triad of shoe stores. Bang opposite KFC, stalls number 12, 13, and 14 are Lajpat Nagar’s hotspot for juttis, kohlapuris and other Indian inspired flats for men, women, and children. The stalls offer more or less the same in terms of design {thread work, cutout, solid colours, and embellishments}, styles, and price ranges. There does exist a certain competitive streak between the three stores, so if you’re in the mood for some theatrics, you can feign disinterest in one, to get yourself a better rate at the next one.</p>

    <updated>2016-04-24T16:53:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/04/24/gk-m-block-market-new-delhi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
Since the 1970s, the Greater Kailash M-Block Market, known locally just as &rsquo;M-block market', has attracted Delhi&rsquo;s upwardly mobile. Positioned side-by-side along a covered walking path, stall vendors flog all sort of knickknacks, making for a colorful afternoon wander.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Greater Kailash’s M Block Market is synonymous with ‘lifestyle’, with its fashion, accessories and cosmetics shops along with outlets of popular international brands.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything from groceries to fast fashion, as well as international street/sport brands such as Puma and Lacoste. But the tip for shopping here is to look beyond the immediately obvious stores to more unusual outlets, such as Tantra Boutique, a great place to snap up a new sari.</p>

<p>A two-part up market is best known for the mother of Fabindia.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
M Block is popular both with the young and the not-so-young who throng the chaat (Indian spicy fast-snack, typically sold at street corners) kiosks and the retail outlets. It has international brands like Benetton, Esprit, Reebok, Giovanni and Sisley. L’Affaire is a local favorite for a sophisticated line of Indian ethnic wear.</p>

<p>Shops that sell gold, silver and diamond ornaments including Orra and De Beers for contemporary designs and Hazoorilal and Rakyan for traditional jewelery are found here.</p>

<p>Many outlets sell western wear and accessories like bags, shoes and scarves. This market is also famous for the pavement vendors who sell tops, cardigans, track suits and other garments which are very much in tune with latest trends at affordable prices.</p>

<p>If you go out for an evening stroll around this market, chances are you will end up buying things – a pair of gloves, stockings, lingerie, cosmetics, silver trinkets, clothes for the kids</p>

<p>The lane behind the market is home to several ladies’ tailors. You can buy ready-to-wear saree blouses or get them stitched.</p>

<p>None of the hustle bustle seen in M Block is seen in the N-Block market next door. A host of retail garment stores, such as Cottons, Kilol and FabIndia do brisk business. FabIndia, Apartment 9, and Episode are niche stores.</p>

<p>The Archana Shopping Complex just opposite to the N block shopping market has some exclusive and affordable boutiques that sell Indian wear and jewelery.</p>

<h1>How to reach the Market:</h1>

<p>The market is easily accessible by local transport within the city and is located near Nehru Place, one of the well known commercial hubs in South Delhi. Most shoppers prefer to get dropped off just outside the market to avoid looking for parking in the scarce space available. You can choose to drive down, hail a cab, take the metro (Kailash colony station and take an auto rickshaw from there to the market) or take an auto rickshaw/cab from anywhere in Delhi to the market.</p>

It has been North Capital Region’s most favourable shopping destination at killer prices. Sarojini Nagar has never been a disappointment whether one has to buy shoes, trendy clothes, fashionable jewellery or designer bags.

Even in summers, when the sun seems especially strong, all the streets of the market are bustling and being elbowed.</p>

<p>All regular shoppers had some advice that sprung from years of experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, you must withdraw enough money before entering the market as the ATMs have long queues.</li>

<li>You must have the quality to bargain and never ask for price. You call out the price you want to pay and walk away if the seller does not agree to your price. Nine out of ten times the vendor will follow you and will give you the thing at your price.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14292315/3a8c39d8-fb85-11e5-8c8c-0af2e5ee19b8.jpg" width="800" height="500" title="Sarojini Bargain" ></p>
