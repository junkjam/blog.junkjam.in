    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250508/6ecce898-73a1-11e6-918f-451afab578b6.jpg" width="400" height="500">
When it comes to choosing the Bridal Lehenga, we just never mind the thousands of rupees as well as the long hours spent in finalizing the same. We take extra initiative to customize it according to our preference and make it more attractive in every way possible. But what happens of that precious piece of clothing, the bridal lehenga , after the wedding. Well if I am not wrong, then half of my readers will raise their hand if I say its wrapped up in a malmal ka kapda safely in the wardrobe. Well here are some great ideas to re use your bridal lehenga in a classy fashion again and again.</p>

<h1>Lessen the volume and Cut it along.</h1>

<p>Though it may sound very harsh and painful but one can surely lessen down the motifs and heavy embellishments by simply cutting it off and toning it down in its look. With the extra kalis removed which was forcefully inserted at that time or event with the net out it will look more subtle and wearable.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250132/b938d0c4-739f-11e6-8ae8-f779a4d6da8a.jpg"></p>

<h1>Switch the style to Anarkali</h1>

<p>With the help of a good tailor, its quite easy to transform your wedding attire to an embellished anarkali which looks less bridal in comparison to a bridal lehenga. The skirt and the blouse can be stitched together with a waist belt or the same can be stitched with a separate simpler blouse to get the desired effect.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250242/46f88c24-73a0-11e6-878e-0abb97a8dcf3.jpg"></p>

<h1>Long Kurtis with Lehengas</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250412/d8b718b0-73a0-11e6-847d-7d36d95ba8ab.jpg" width="500" height="600">
This is one of the most preferred styles that have hit the fashion world with a bang. And it is also a great way to reuse the bridal lehenga with a toned kurti and set the look. Even jackets with thin borders are also a good option to try along.</p>

<h1>Combining the bridal set with other attires</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg">
Usually the bridal lehenga teamed up with designer blouses and embellished dupatta forms the bridal set and altogether they provide the bridal feel. So the best way is to team the lehenga with a toned top, wear the blouse with a plain skirt and use the dupatta with a neutral shaded salwar kameez.</p>

<h1>Color Blocks</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250285/73bdf9e2-73a0-11e6-8379-7be272a1b291.jpg">
It is not always necessary to team up bridal lehenga with same colored blouses. Color blocking is quite in the fashion so if the idea is to attend some wedding function then pair up the embellished lehenga with a no work blouse of different color and just set the elegant look for the occasion.</p>

<h1>Drape it as a saree</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg">
There are many cases when the lehenga sets have a long flowing dupatta with loads of zari work on it. The best way to tone the dress down and still keep the charm is to drape the dupatta as a saree pallu and use a toned down blouse to maintain the classy look</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250508/6ecce898-73a1-11e6-918f-451afab578b6.jpg"></p>

<h1>Use as it is</h1>

<p>We all love our lehengas and honestly there are many who just don’t want to alter it. For them the best way to use it is by wearing it just as it is but with a simpler accessories, toned make up, and by letting the hair fall casually.</p>

    <link href="https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/09/03/period-on-your-wedding-day/"/>

    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/09/03/period-on-your-wedding-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18057833/388b1bfa-6e2f-11e6-909b-e36c5d673d28.jpg" width="500" height="600">
Wedding Day is the most special day of every girl’s life. So, the special day of your life is about to arrive. Everything is planned, the perfect dress, the most romantic venue of the city, honeymoon destination, and what not? But oops! What’s happening? You suddenly realize your chums are here and you definitely did not invite them to your wedding. Well, the best way to avoid such a situation is to try and fit it into your marriage plans much before the time. If you happen to experience your period on wedding day, a few things can be done to avoid any kind of mishaps.
The first thing to be done is stay calm and composed. Keep a smile pasted to your face and enjoy the day. Here are some tips for you in case you happen to experience period on the most auspicious day of your life:</p>

<h1>Rush to the doctor</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18058016/14777b54-6e30-11e6-872f-34f4ccc3da38.jpg" width="600" height="500">
In any case of uneasiness or a disease, all of us look for the doctor. Similarly, if you have these uninvited guests suddenly interrupting the special occasion of your life, doctor’s clinic is not far away! Start taking the pills two weeks before your period is due, it may delay your next period for your day. This might not be a foolproof solution though, but help’s for sure.</p>

<h1>Use a menstrual cup</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18058048/3c0b9786-6e30-11e6-96d6-e95ba80dca33.jpg">
They really do help: The menstrual cups can prove to be great help for the ‘aunt flo’ blunder that just took place. These cups can easily be inserted into the vagina and help cover the opening to the cervix. Tampons can also be used as a backup, otherwise pads are always your best friend during your menstrual cycle. These help prevent leakage. If you want to keep things tidy on your wedding night, the cup can also be inserted prior to sex.</p>

<h1>Make love on your wedding night anyways</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18057878/6d0618ee-6e2f-11e6-960c-e9cdb6fae890.jpg">
Due to extra sensitivity as well as lubrication, some women enjoy being intimate during their menstrual flow whereas, on the other hand, some find it more painful. Well, the whole thing entirely depends upon you and your better half. If your partner is ok with it, just go ahead and have an intercourse. Just make sure to take tiny precautions in order to avoid untidiness, like bring a towel along so that you can place it down to protect the bed.</p>

<p>In short, any of the brides can experience this mishap on the very special day of her life, but not to worry girls! There is always a solution to everything. Just don’t panic too much! Keep calm and tranquil, it’s your day girl! Enjoy it to the fullest and don’t forget to wear a smile all day long. This smile will add on to your glow on the wedding day. Discuss this with your friends and know each other’s experience in case such a thing ever happened to anyone of you.</p>

    <link href="https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/09/03/teachers-day/"/>
    <updated>2016-09-03T13:30:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/09/03/teachers-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225112/167eff1c-7209-11e6-99cf-c6beb0d2bec8.jpg" width="500" height="600">
During our school days we had so many friends that we had to cut short the names of who to call on our birthdays and family
functions but when we grow up, after college and come into the corporate world, people get busy in their respective lives.
There are just a few friends left who remain close to our heart but our educators, our teachers are the ones who have thousands of people who remember them for ages.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225115/16879b40-7209-11e6-85f4-38703cabe40d.jpg" title="" >
Teachers moud us into respectable human beings and give us such life lessons that help us in our lives.
Isn’t it our moral duty to remember our teachers on their special day and make them feel special?
Teachers are the inspirational figures who give us the courage to constantly keep moving.
However, take out time from your corporate lives and make them feel special this teacher’s day.</p>

<h1>Token of appreciation</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225113/1680c78e-7209-11e6-8655-86c4fd6adbad.jpg">
Teachers deserve appreciation as they remember thousands of names, they know what we are best at and our weakness as well.
Take out time and order a gift of gratitude for them like a basket full of their favorite things (if at all, you remember what they like), you can also draw and make a special card for them or a scrapbook (if you have images with your teacher).
This gesture of appreciation will make the teachers feel it down their spine and will be a wonderful sign of gratification.</p>

<h1>Think creatively</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225111/15fff71c-7209-11e6-844a-887ddeb977b8.gif">
This is the era where people are not able to spare time for their families, they are so busy and engrossed in the daily chores that maintaining relations becomes a complicated task.
You don’t have to go out of the way but you can simply make your teachers feel special by making a creative picture and sending it on their Facebook with a heartwarming wish or a heartfelt message for them, make it certain that your teachers acknowledge the message and wishes.</p>

<h1>Celebrate together</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225119/364b684e-7209-11e6-9d82-5aa61b44ad9c.jpg">
Teachers are more than just our mentors, they are our role models. And if we can surprise them by going out of the way to meet them, nothing like it. Celebrate their special day and make them feel that they are important for you.
These are small-small things that make a huge difference.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/18225114/1682527a-7209-11e6-9fe5-d168a5769271.jpg">
We might consider these things as trivial but for our teachers, it makes a huge difference for them when their pass-out students remember them and make them feel on the seventh heaven. This is just an act of reverence to make them feel wanted and upright. If you think about the school and college days; don’t you remember how your teachers molded into what you are today?
How they took pains to help you in growing up? On this teacher’s day, make them feel special and watch a beam appear across their faces.</p>

Dry or crude denim, rather than washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed in the wake of being colored amid its creation. Most denim is washed subsequent to being made into a piece of attire. It is done so keeping in mind the end goal to make it milder and to wipe out any shrinkage which could bring about a thing to not fit after the proprietor washes it. Notwithstanding being washed, non-dry denim is some of the time falsely distressed to accomplish a well-used in look.</p>

<h2>2.  Selvage Denim</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798143/745a2a54-65ec-11e6-90c2-0acac849f0e1.jpg">
Selvage denim is a sort of denim which frames a spotless normal edge that does not unwind. It is ordinarily introduced in the unwashed or crude state.

These mixes engage the individuals who like the look of denim yet favor polyester mixes that wash and dry rapidly and are lighter in weight and somewhat dressier.

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17798253/481ec084-65ed-11e6-93ef-ea4937829b7c.jpg">
These are the complete pieces that each lady additionally needs in her storage room. Cardigans and coats are the top two decisions to decide upon when going out. I cherish the look of an overcoat tossed over a tee dressed over a flowy shirt. Cardigans and coats have a great deal of variety, so make sure you pick the ones which you feel can go with maximum number of your dresses.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643124/c4a69736-617d-11e6-9281-0fc81faa40ee.jpg" width="600" height="500">
Dress ‘em up, or dress ‘em down, dungarees are the new wardrobe staple. Frequently
spotted on celebrities and bloggers alike, dungarees make for a fun, chic addition to your
style. Why? They instantly amp up swag quotient, and are utterly easy to carry. With the
chills setting in slowly, now is the perfect time to lend a brand new spin to your style with
this hot fashion pick.
To help you ease into the trend, here go four stunning variants of the dungaree that you can
opt for. Buckle up, and soak in all the inspiration you can:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>The classic distressed dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643050/571a8b52-617b-11e6-88e2-0577a08b960e.jpg" width="500" height="400">
Love distressed denims? Take them a notch higher with distressed dungarees that are the
perfect pick for a fun day out with your gal pals. Team them up with this season’s hottest
fashion favourite – cropped tees, and slip into a pair of white oxfords or sneakers to
complete the casual chic look.</p>

<h1>Dungaree shorts</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643049/56ee73dc-617b-11e6-9e46-3e9486348c04.jpg" width="500" height="400">
Showcase your fun side (and, those toned gams) with dungaree shorts that look playfully
flirty! Couple them with a graphic tank top and sneakers to lend just the finishing touch your
look needs. If not denim, pick a printed pair to add a dash of feminine, and swap the
sneakers for strappy sandals!</p>

<h1>Formal black dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643048/56a87468-617b-11e6-8103-d34b1c3eb0b7.jpg" width="600" height="600">
On your next evening out, ditch the classic cocktail dress and grab a pair of formal black
dungarees to make for some serious power dressing. Wear them over a crisp white shirt,
and a pair of pointy stiletto heels to maintain the perfect balance between formal and</p>

<h1>Layered up</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643051/571b479a-617b-11e6-85e5-5679b30287a0.jpg" width="500" height="400">
Scarves, jackets, shrugs and even overcoats – dungarees go well with each of the layers,
thereby, giving your look an all new edge. For a casual event, wrap a statement contrast
scarf around your neck and style your hair into a high-rise messy bun. For a formal event, on
the other hand, simply rest your jacket or overcoat on your shoulders and opt for pointy
heels to complete the look.</p>

<p>No longer tricky, are they? Rush now, flaunt your love for dungarees by incorporating trendy
accessories to team them up with, and leave a long-lasting impression on your onlookers.</p>

What is the greatest highlight of Delhi shopping? Many may answer, that shopping in the cosmopolitan Delhi malls has revolutionized the shopping experience. But the hidden truth is different. Though the city malls are quite attractive but in comparison to the charm and attraction of the Delhi street markets, it’s nothing. The most convenient proof of the statement is the overcrowded; jam packed areas of the age old traditional markets of Delhi throughout the year.
One of such a traditional market is the Tibetan Market located on the western side of Janpath.  From designer clothing to stylish accessories, home décor to Tibetan artifacts, footwear to woolen clothes get it all in best quality and that too in throw back prices. Seems unbelievable? Well not, the market is one of the most preferred shopping destinations in the capital city.</p>

Originally the place was designed to house in Tibetan refugees in 1960. But what initiated as a small locality dedicated to the fugitives soon got transferred into one of the popular shopping locations of the city. It is the rising fame of the market with its cheap price and quality products that it soon became a tourist spot in Delhi and became christened with the name, the Monastery market.

<h1>What remains in Offer for you?</h1>

<p>Though Tibetan market has a host of products to offer, it is known a lot for its resplendent collection of woolen garments.

Leather products and footwear are also quite cheap here. The small Tibetan world also holds a wide collection of exquisite Lucky charms, Tibetan bric-a-brac , Om danglers, Tibetan souvenirs and many other exclusive products.

<h1>Food to Savor in Tibetan Market</h1>

<p>Shoppers usually are great foodies too. And even if they are not, shopping for stretched hours calls for re energizing with delicious food which gets fulfilled in the market with a wide collection of flavors from Tibet.

Even if the prices seem to be very reasonable but still you can bargain to a great extent and save your valuable money. Here you will not only find the local people of Mumbai but also foreigners shopping, as this market is only a few kilometers away from Taj Hotel and other iconic landmarks like Gateway of India. If you want to watch a movie then you can also go to one of the oldest Theatre, Regal Cinema, which is located near the market.

<h1>Fashion Street</h1>

<p>Another amazing shopping area in Mumbai is the famous Fashion Street, which perfectly fits its name. Here, you will find all the latest fashion clothes, accessories, cosmetics, and much more at affordable prices. These also include first copies of popular brands. Situated in South Mumbai, this street is a cluster of about 385 street side clothing shops placed on MG Road near Azad Maidan, opposite to Bombay Gymkhana. Along with being a favorite shopping street of the locals as well as the visitors, it is also a popular tourist destination located opposite to VSNL office building at MG Road. As we know, the more you bargain, the better price you fetch for particular apparel, so another advantage of shopping here is that it is well known for bargaining. Not only this, but in order to show concern for environment, in January 2011, as a part of green drive of BMC in collaboration with Fashion Street Shop Owners’ Association, the market at Fashion Street banned the use of plastic bags and polybags, and started using paper bags, made by the training workshop of the National Association of the Blind.

    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/07/16/the-freshest-pre-fall-2016-collections-straight-from-the-runway</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893405/4bdc7c74-4b54-11e6-8489-72c814ebbc59.jpg" width="360" height="600" title="Pre Fall 2016" >

<p><img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893388/4b54bba4-4b54-11e6-8f93-01ad8b824da8.jpg" width="500" height="650"></p>

<h1>Prep your look for the season:</h1>

<h2>1. Office Casuals</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893389/4b581100-4b54-11e6-9585-d4d5ae1b9a77.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893392/4b5bb97c-4b54-11e6-9f06-4878565ec8cf.jpg" width="360" height="600">
When you’re an office-goer and you have the freedom to wear whatever you want, instead of a professional look you can also opt for an office-casual look. Patchwork jeans or vintage dresses can be a hit as well. We are not hinting at sweaty pants or revealing outfits but have you thought about off-shoulder tops or dresses?
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893391/4b590c9a-4b54-11e6-9350-b9f2c9ede222.jpg">
The off-shoulder trend has fevered at an alarming pace and if you do not like to expose your arms, off-shoulders are at rescue for your arms. If you wish to wear the off-shoulder look at office you can pair the outfit with cigarette pants or pinstripe skirt, tie a bun and handle the corporate world in style.</p>

<h2>2. Party Popper</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893393/4b5d1d4e-4b54-11e6-94dd-af07accee2c4.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893404/4bdaeda0-4b54-11e6-8fc6-f8ba4ec90566.jpg" width="360" height="600">
The belted dresses are perhaps, the first choice for this Pre-Fall. These belted dresses are ultra-flattering on various body types and you can pull them off easily ‘because they’re guaranteed to start a legacy with cohorts admiring your style.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893394/4b8fcdca-4b54-11e6-8f12-75e18ab2d4a3.jpg">
Select a dress that is breeze-friendly and isn’t too sticky considering the weather and to note the style, nothing would exhibit your glowing skin like these belted dresses with a tad bit lower hemline, that’s just about it.</p>

<h2>3. The T-Shirt Look</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893396/4b950038-4b54-11e6-95fb-f837eb72939b.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893397/4b975324-4b54-11e6-8fd4-1e27b266d20c.jpg" width="360" height="600">
Its the Pre-Fall season and all we wish to do is to Baywatch or perhaps, drink margaritas and wear T-shirts, jeans or shorts but if you are in a 9 to 5 job you can’t really live this dream, can you? Me neither. If you are an office goer, T-shirts can be worn just when you get the knack to pull-off the T-Shirt look.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893395/4b93b9ee-4b54-11e6-8a96-469928486e88.jpg">
A cropped T-shirt with a high-waist pencil skirt is a hit. Or a plain T-shirt with a midi-skirt can do wonders for you. Why don’t you pull off this T-shirt look? Stay comfortable yet corporate.</p>

<h2>4. Shorts-in-Style</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893398/4b9a3ce2-4b54-11e6-8ef9-556d9973b4c9.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893402/4bd06a6a-4b54-11e6-9074-8a032b647b57.jpg" width="360" height="300">
Well! Don&rsquo;t you want to pull out those denim shorts hanging in your closet and take to the road in the perfect street style? Yes, it’s August and you’re exactly thinking what we’re thinking. If you are bored to wear the cutoffs with a pretty tank or with a bodysuit, it’s finally time to tick-present on the denim shorts waiting to be worn.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893399/4b9cbe90-4b54-11e6-9776-3dee109b2379.jpg">
Prep-up and play with the wardrobe essentials to pull-off a wonderful look. You can also wear denim shorts with gladiators, a belt bag and tank top or a crop top. It preps up the street style and looks just perfect.</p>

<h2>5. Mix-and-Match</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893400/4bceedf2-4b54-11e6-9d4b-09fbe74319ba.jpg" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893403/4bd3e0dc-4b54-11e6-9805-8a22543971cf.jpg" width="360" height="600">
It&rsquo;s time to mix and match bright and shiny hues like lemon yellow, cherry red, emerald green as it pepper up the entire outfit and makes one look, attractive and pretty. Just in case you fear bright hues, you have no idea how the mix-and-match can swing your entire attire into an exceptionally striking one. What say?
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893401/4bd023f2-4b54-11e6-9463-c948426a0a4a.jpg">
Lemon yellow shirt dress prepped up with gold accessories or an emerald green with brown knee-length boots would surely steal many glances around.
<img class="center" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893390/4b58e2e2-4b54-11e6-9689-af80213e9e63.jpg">
The Pre Fall &lsquo;16 collection is all about mixing and matching the bright hues and staying comfortable in whatever you wear. Because experimenting with style and trying out new looks is just so fashionista-type. Try out these looks and all eyes will be on you.</p>

Everyone complains that Delhi is too costly but is it?? Really? The answer is no, it’s not!! If Delhi has luxurious Malls, best of restaurants then at the same time it also has some amazing street food and street shopping which starts from just Rs.10. So, if you are in Delhi and thinking of shopping at affordable rates, then below is a quick list of Delhi’s Best Street Markets for Girls Shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Janpath:</h2>

<p>This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888351/1738fb2a-4afd-11e6-8b4e-a1a91aef5e7e.jpg">

<h2>2. Sarojini Nagar Market:</h2>

<p>Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.</p>

<h2>3. Chandni Chowk:</h2>

<p>One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883036/a3765876-4adf-11e6-9615-53bc16f73f84.jpg" width="500" height="650" title="New Market Kolkata" >
Kolkata is the city of joy, where we find many shopping markets to fulfill our shopping needs. This crowded city provides us with many markets like New Market, Gariahat market, Chandni Market etc. In this blog post, we are going to explore in detail about New Market in Kolkata. This market stands on Lindsey Street and was established as a rich arcade to fulfill the shopping requirements of the British-colonist population of the city. As soon as it was opened at the beginning of 1874, it started attracting people from all over India, who spent money in the exclusive shops of this market.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once, British departed this country, New Market had become Indianised. However, its red-brick, ornate exterior still remains British-looking. Its compact clock tower, which rises from its eastern wall, makes us remember the British Empire era.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg"></p>

<p>Inside of New Market you will find a shopping market named S. S. Hawg Market which looks very tangled, however it contains a grid of narrow alleys which are bisecting one another and so many shops and stalls are arranged in neat blocks. You will always find this market busy and crowded and whenever you come at this place, you will find it architecturally chaotic. The boundaries of the market are complicated for defining since it has a basement also, likewise overcrowded with retailers, whose far end seems emerging in another building which contains many more floors of shops. Additionally, of course, the vendors scatter outside the main building and sell their products on the surrounding streets also._</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg"></p>

<p>We need not to say that you can but absolutely everything here you want. Be it grocery item, fruit and vegetable, meat, fish, toys, toiletries, cosmetics, wigs, sandals, shoes, flowers, electric appliances, kitchen utensils, crockery, crystal, silverware, jewelry, dresses, wallets, bags, scarves, shawls, or suitcases, you can find everything in this incredible street market of Kolkata. Even, you will see astrologer, money-changer and barber shops also in this market.
Well, if you are a bag lover and you are on the search for a handbag in this market, you will get completely confused and will be spoilt for choice, as you will find a million bags on sale here in this great street market.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg"></p>

<p>Entering New Market, you can see not only Indians but also the foreigners who visit this market for shopping regularly. Not only street products, you will find every brand’s outlet in this market, whether it is of dresses or of shoes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg"></p>

<p>New Market is not only tourist-friendly; but also the place of foodies as well. Undoubtedly, this place contains the modern shopping malls where you can find top-notch quality products anytime. In a nutshell, this is the place where you can spend your complete weekend, if you are shopaholic and foodie person.</p>
