    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564308-0a237100-80cc-11ea-9dc4-4845596e6ac2.jpg" width="400" height="500"/><noscript><img class="left" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564308-0a237100-80cc-11ea-9dc4-4845596e6ac2.jpg" width="400" height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564308-0a237100-80cc-11ea-9dc4-4845596e6ac2.jpg"></noscript></p>

<p>The latest prime amazon series Four More Shots, Please! is a toast to, much underrated, female friendship. The web series is a sequel of the series ‘Four Shots, Please!, which was released early in the year 2019. Though, the latter version gives you way better content to watch.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It may appear like Veere Di Wedding, or Sex and the City with four girls exploring different aspects of life. But just to excite you, the series is way better than those.</p>

<p>Four more shots, please! starts with the staggered friendship of four girls and takes on a journey of being saviors of each other, after the pact &ldquo;ye dosti ham nahi todenge, the best ship is friendship and to never jumping the ship off, again!’</p>

<p>The 10-episode series begins with the disoriented life of 4-girls, who are trying to work on their flawed life, supporting each other, with friendly taunts and banter now and then.</p>

<p>Besides female friendship, Devika Bhagat and Ishita Moitra (story writer of the series) have tried their best to provide the best kind of content, which will keep the audience lured to the following episodes.</p>

<p><img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564305-08f24400-80cc-11ea-9ddc-ff4a01dec01d.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564305-08f24400-80cc-11ea-9ddc-ff4a01dec01d.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564305-08f24400-80cc-11ea-9ddc-ff4a01dec01d.jpg"></noscript></p>

<p>The female-oriented series focuses on different aspects of women’s lives. Starting from mood swings associated with hormones, stereotypes, body shaming, relationship concerns, emotional breakdown, work pay inequality, unsatisfied sex, fake orgasms, and domestic misogyny.</p>

<p>The best part about the story is every character has a story of their own. And every story, though on a different track, carries substance. Their personal and professional life have been given equal gravity.</p>

<p>A writer with her book issue remains influenced by she was bought-up, and that in turn, affects her relationships. A divorcee single-mother who happens to be a lawyer has worked very hard in her twenties, and now she is clueless about what she wants in her thirties. A bisexual physical trainer is in love with a celebrity, who is insecure about the growing popularity of the partner. And, a south Bombay girl is yet on the voyage of her self-discovery because she had everything in abundance.</p>

<p>In the run, the writer has smoothly included male members, provided them with adequate screen time, and gave them their due credit. After all, that is what real feminism is about!</p>

<p>There is a small section about patriotism and politics, where bigotry is given the limelight and a little lecture about the difference between the love of country and love to the country. This adds feather to the storyline, I must say!</p>

<p><img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564298-0394f980-80cc-11ea-843e-8f62053a6345.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564298-0394f980-80cc-11ea-843e-8f62053a6345.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/79564298-0394f980-80cc-11ea-843e-8f62053a6345.jpg"></noscript></p>

<p>However, progressiveness is a little hyped here. Or that is what I felt because I don’t see unmarried women discussing her pregnancy often, in India. There were few more not-so-relatable real-life scenarios, targeting the Indian audience and life-style in mind.
But that hardly makes a difference in the entertainment part.</p>

<p>The sweet sassy and savage banter, again ends on a disoriented point, with girls holding hands and leaving the audience craving for more Four Shots!</p>

<p>Registering response of people, the series scores 8.5/10</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/47265702-b6bd7a80-d549-11e8-8cee-7fbf9bab907c.jpg" width="400" height="500"/><noscript><img class="left" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/47265702-b6bd7a80-d549-11e8-8cee-7fbf9bab907c.jpg" width="400" height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/47265702-b6bd7a80-d549-11e8-8cee-7fbf9bab907c.jpg"></noscript>
It is being said, that the physical attraction takes around 3-6 months time to fade away.  After which, you would see what is the actual scenario, is it the personality of the person you fell for, or just the body. So, after your honeymoon period of romance and passion, the days have started to dry up. You have the same person, you want to make love , but don’t really know, how to re-ignite that fire. Some people, indulge in sex games, other people go to travel. But not all the time, we have that much of time, or money.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Have you ever heard of roleplays? Well, these are easy scenes, where you get to play some character and enact the entire scene. People love them, because, they feel like other person, and things for a change, begin to look as different. Only thing you would want here is a pertner, who would be open for this.</p>

<p>Therefore, 7 easy role plays for you, so that , you can try and feel a new sensation, well, at least for 7 times.</p>

<h4>1.  House owner and the tenant</h4>

<p>Consider, one of you as the house owner and the other one as the tenant. So, the house owner comes home to collect the rent, which hasn’t been transferred for the last 3 months now. As the house owner wants money and the tenant is out of cash, the tenant starts seducing the house owner, a fair deal according to the tenant. Since, the house owner had always been physically attracted to the tenant, after little hesitation, the house owner succumbs to the plan. Now, beauty of the scene is , anyone of you can be the house owner and the tenant. Only thing is, the tenant has to do more hard work( if you know, what it means).</p>

<h4>2.  Teacher and the student’s guardian</h4>

<p>You get the diary of your child/young sibling with the remarks, that you need to meet the teacher. You go to see the teacher but it is already late, and the teacher tells you , since you didn’t come on time, now your child/ sibling has to be marked failed. After a lot of request, the teacher agrees to see you at his/her place, because it is the time of closure of school. You go to the teacher’s place , with an intension to discuss, what can be done, but the teacher starts seducing you and doesn’t want to take no for an answer. You also, get drawn towards the teacher.</p>

<h4>3.  Patient and the fake Doctor</h4>

<p>Now, you have seen this person with your usual doctor, a lot of times, so, you automatically assumed the other person to be a doctor also. You had always exchanged few glances and smiles, but never really knew the person’s name or occupation. Once when you had gone to show some report of your family member, you don’t find your usual doctor there, but this person, who was also waiting for the doctor. You started talking to this person and then this person, fakes to be other doctor, and asks if you have a problem, because you are  also attracted to this person, you show off your back of the neck, or belly, or thighs ( depending which part is more sensitive), and this fake doctor starts seducing you.</p>

<h4>4.  With the partner’s roommate</h4>

<p>So, you are in a long distance relationship and all you know where does your partner stay, you have talked to your partner’s roommate a few times, and sometimes find the roomamate attractive or you have a hunch that the roommate is also attracted to you. You never moved further thinking about your relationship. Once day, you thought of visiting for 2 days to your partner’s place , a surprise visit. When you reach there, you get to know, that the partner has gone to some family event and will be home the next day. You want to go, but the roommate tells you it is only for a day and you can stay there. The roommate gets you drunk and starts to touch you inappropriate way and you give up.</p>

<h4>5.  Workout friend drops you home</h4>

<p>This guy/girl is someone you always see in the gym. The way this person exercise always turns you on and you had always been fantasizing this person. You had also caught this person looking at you and then both of you exchange smiles. One day, when you think of walking down to the store near your place, you find this person, honking at you , and asking if you need a lift. Even if you can walk to the home, you still take a lift, hoping you can invite this person, to your place. When you invite this person, after little reluctance this person agrees to come to your place. You want to offer water, and while offering you deliberately spill little water on your Gym friend, then you tell this person to take off the top and when this person does that, you take the towel, and slowly start wiping the water. Your gym friend is also turning on and is finding is hard to control…..rest is your way.</p>

<h4>6.  Your partner’s colleague</h4>

<p>You are having really bad relationship with you partner for a really long time now. But you go to the official parties with your partner and there is this one person, who you find attractive and soft spoken. The way of talking of this person gets you turned on. You also know, that this person might be attracted to you, because you have exchanged some flirtatious texts with each other, nothing really happened. So, one evening, when your partner is on leave, this person drops in to check in with your partner, since your partner has taken sick leave and is out for a trip with friends. When you tell that to this person, you become sad, and this person comes to console you, it starts with a hug, then a kiss on cheek, then a quick lip kiss, both of you realize it, but cant stop, you should lock your lips again and then you go the way you want.</p>

<h4>7.  The new intern in other office</h4>

<p>This new person is someone now you have started to see in the office next to you. Sometimes, you have seen each other in the office cafeteria, sometimes you have bumped into each other in the lift, but you never really got any chance to talk to each other. Whenever this person leaves, you always exchange a smile and also, till the time you see this person, you keep on exchanging short glances. One day, you happen to be out of your home and you find this person, just outside out home, next door, struggling. When asked, this person tells you that the phone is dead, and she/he came to visit a friend who lives here. So, this person had no option than to wait there. Since, you live alone, you invite that person inside. And offer tea or coffee, then both of you start talking and this person tells you about  his/her new appointment as an intern. Then while this intern wants to keep the cups and saucers in the kitchen , you try stopping this person, and hug this person tightly.</p>

    <updated>2018-09-26T00:22:19+05:30</updated>
    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2018/09/26/whats-your-love-language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg" width="400" height="500"/><noscript><img class="left" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg" width="400" height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg"></noscript>
So, This is really a new way of talking, isn’t it! Dr. Gary Chapman coined the term love language to express how we express and receive love. So, it is not only based for romantic partner, but you can also identify what works for you at a usual basis. We have been hearing that a male’s and a female’s brain is different, but this is something where it is only about the type of love language that suits you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, let us go through the five types of Love Languages , so that you can also identify which is a good fit for you .</p>

<h3>1. Quality Time</h3>

<p>Quality time is about spending time together enjoying each other’s company.
<img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038014-94416880-c127-11e8-9396-6790c848852b.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038014-94416880-c127-11e8-9396-6790c848852b.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038014-94416880-c127-11e8-9396-6790c848852b.jpg"></noscript></p>

<h4>How to communicate:</h4>

<p>Put down your phone and other things that mostly distract you. Focus on uninterrupted interaction or discussion. One on one time is very critical. You must have heard something called as “Me Time”, there has to be an “Our Time” also.</p>

<h4>Actions to take:</h4>

<p>Create special moments together like scheduling and going for a walk together, doing or indulging in some activities with your spouse, going for a weekend getaways or even travelling somewhere close by.</p>

<h4>Things to avoid:</h4>

<p>Having distractions like Mobile apps, games, chatting with someone else, long stint without spending time with each other.</p>

<h3>2. Physical Touch</h3>

<p>Physical touch is showing love through hugging, cuddling, being intimate or simply putting a caring hand on someone’s shoulder. Sometimes, your partner might be more physically active than you. Even if you don’t like it, you should indulge or try to be in it happily, because that is one way of making your partner happy.
<img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038012-94416880-c127-11e8-860f-d2dc7abb96d9.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038012-94416880-c127-11e8-860f-d2dc7abb96d9.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038012-94416880-c127-11e8-860f-d2dc7abb96d9.jpg"></noscript></p>

<h4>How to communicate:</h4>

<p>Non Verbal use of Body Language , which emphasizes love and care , for eg. Holding hands, hugging, moving your fingers along your partner’s hair.</p>

<h4>Actions to take:</h4>

<p>Showing physical affection regularly and make physical intimacy a thoughtful priority.</p>

<h4>Things to avoid:</h4>

<p>Physical neglect, a long stint without intimacy, receiving affection coldly</p>

<h3>3. Receiving Gifts</h3>

<p>Yes, this had to be featured in the list. When you gifted something to your crush from that gift shop or you received the gift, you saved that thing for so long, because it was dear to you. For few people, this becomes a really important step during their relationship.
<img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/46038010-93a8d200-c127-11e8-871f-964f38802105.jpg"></noscript></p>

<h4>How to communicate:</h4>

<p>Thoughtfulness, make your partner’s choice priority, speak purposefully.</p>

<h4>Actions to take:</h4>

<p>Give thoughtful gifts, small things matter in a big way, People in this category, don’t really are looking for expensive gifts, for them, it is the thought that counts.</p>

<h4>Things to avoid:</h4>

<p>Forgetting special occasions, unenthusiastic gift receiving.</p>

    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2018/09/24/7-things-that-a-partner-expects-from-you-but-would-never-tell-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45991539-fc01a000-c0a2-11e8-8292-a3675a4cf725.jpg" width="400" height="500"/><noscript><img class="left" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45991539-fc01a000-c0a2-11e8-8292-a3675a4cf725.jpg" width="400" height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45991539-fc01a000-c0a2-11e8-8292-a3675a4cf725.jpg"></noscript>
There were days, when men used to control the household and women used to follow. Now, in majority of households, people start to follow equality between husbands and wives. Even after all these things, a woman usually has complains that her man is not fulfilling her demands without realizing that a man might also have few things to ask for. Psychologically speaking, men do not like ask things other than food and physical intimacy, but here are 7 things which they expect from their wives but won’t tell her. These results came out after a survey of 173 men aged 27-65yrs in relationship (marriage included).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>1.  Admiration</h4>

<p>First thing to make it to the top is admiration. Admiration is the combination of love and respect. So, if you had been thinking , that your husband seeks only respect from you or only love, you are wrong. Especially, if you are in a public place, make sure that you show respect towards him. I am not saying he can be disrespectful. But a man takes a note of this , that how his wife is treating him in Public.</p>

<h4>2.  Supportive</h4>

<p>Another important factor is being supportive. A man would rarely say that he is having some problem or he needs you emotionally, but if you know him, you know, he wants that support. When he presents any idea to you, rather than declining it at the very first stage, take time to listen to the idea. It might be a chance that the idea presented is just not worth it, but when you are listening to the idea, just listen don’t just hear, to say NO at the end.</p>

<h4>3.  Intelligent</h4>

<p>In our country, the perception of intelligence is so wrong, that most of the people end up saying that they are not intelligent. In India, Marks in the examination are the only source which tell us who is intelligent. But that is not true. Intelligence is basically the skill to handle problems without getting annoyed. If you are not told how to do certain things, even then you can do it by trying, then that mean you are intelligent. So, handling a situation independently and nicely is a sign of good intelligence.</p>

<h4>4.  Family Oriented</h4>

<p>This is a big one. We know, that in India, we “have to” be family oriented. But when someone says family oriented, in India it just doesn’t mean only your children and partner. Family includes your parents as well and siblings. A woman who is more family oriented and has kept the family together is loved more. Now, with that statement, I am very sure, you might be thinking about Parvati Bhabhi and Tulsi Viraani, but even if you are a working woman, spending quality time with your entire family on festivals is something to be valued.</p>

<h4>5.  Mixing</h4>

<p>This nature is deeply appreciated by men. They value a woman who is of mixing nature. Ever seen that family member, whenever there is a festival, this person doesn’t talk to anyone, doesn’t like to spend time with other members and is always sulking. Don’t be like that person. No matter how much you dislike your relative, once if you smile by heart and try to mix, you would be appreciated. By mixing, I don’t mean, you need to ask them person or offending questions, I mean focusing only on the present event.</p>

<h4>6.  Independent</h4>

<p>You don’t’ have to be financially independent if you are not working. Being independent means, not depending on anybody. Let us say, the gas is over and you need to order a refill. You are waiting for your husband, because only he books the refill. Have you ever thought, for such small little things, how much are you dependent on your husband. Dependency is good, but codependency is better. A person working for long hours and gets to hear a list of such errands may make your man upset.</p>

<h4>7.  Open to experiment</h4>

<p>Now this is the point where it gets little bold. If you have a partner who wants to try new things whether it may be related to food or on bed, you may want to be open. Psychologically speaking, the more you try new things with your partner, the more you get attached to him.</p>

<p>So, these are the factors, which a man might not be very open to discuss with you but would always expect from you. But at the end, nothing else matters if the love is pure from both the ends.</p>

Bollywood has always shown gay members in a ridicule-worthy way. The main motive was to add an extra zing of comedy to the movie. They are never shown as the accepted members of the society. However here are few progressive bollywood films where the actor has convincingly played the role of a gay person. Kudos to the bollywood directors for initiating and presenting the following beautiful movies about LGBT community.</p>

<p>Now that section 377 has been scrapped, maybe we can find more such movies. We need movies that are sensitive and more realistic towards the LGBT community. Not to mention above movies have faced their share of criticism and were condemn in certain parts. Though there were parts in movie that failed in refinement and were not able to break the stereotype but we shall be overwhelmed and honoured by each and every member of the film who took / will take a step towards gay rights and for creating awareness among every citizen of India.</p>

The weather in the Maldives is just incredible regardless of the season you visit. Just make sure you pack a lot of sunscreens and you will be able to enjoy the sunshine every day.</p>

<h4>2. Seclusion</h4>

The Maldives is largely water, with over 1000 little islands. Most islands are uninhabited, and those with people just contain a couple of resorts on the whole island. This implies that there won’t be too many people. Some of the islands just have a couple of villas, which means that the whole island will probably have less than ten couples on it at one time. It&rsquo;s considerably more enjoyable to appreciate the shoreline when there are fewer people.</p>

<h4>3. Diving and Snorkeling</h4>

<p><img class="center lazy" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45594111-c0841900-b9b2-11e8-840b-02e4f2f49712.jpg" width="500" height="600"/><noscript><img class="center" data-original="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45594111-c0841900-b9b2-11e8-840b-02e4f2f49712.jpg" width="500" height="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082157/45594111-c0841900-b9b2-11e8-840b-02e4f2f49712.jpg"></noscript>
