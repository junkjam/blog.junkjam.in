<p>Skydiving is a sport in which participants jump or fall from aircraft at altitude. They can perform an assortment of aerial manoeuvres before deploying a parachute to slow their descent, allowing them to come gently to rest on the Earth below. The sport is also known as parachuting, in a reference to that vital piece of safety equipment. People at different levels of physical fitness can participate in skydiving, as long as they are ready for an adrenalin-packed sport which can be both terrifying and exhilarating.</p>

<h1>Types of Sky Dives</h1>

<h2>1. Tandem Jump</h2>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402596/dacd0606-e622-11e6-9a52-e5ac1ba43726.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402596/dacd0606-e622-11e6-9a52-e5ac1ba43726.gif</a>"></p>

<p>The simplest form of skydiving in India, here you are connected to an instructor via a harness. Both of you jump together using the same parachute and the instructor pulls the cord.</p>

<p>Note: You need only minimal instruction before this jump.</p>

<h2>2. Static Line Jump</h2>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402739/af6167f0-e627-11e6-8db1-ca74fe281fbb.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402739/af6167f0-e627-11e6-8db1-ca74fe281fbb.png</a>"></p>

<p>In this skydive you are connected with a cord to the aircraft. And the parachute opens automatically after around 3 seconds of freefall with no action required by the passenger.</p>

<p>Note: The jump is made from only 3000 feet and requires upto 6 hours of training.</p>

<h2>3. Accelerated Free Fall</h2>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402737/af517976-e627-11e6-8048-245cec4fc43d.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/22402737/af517976-e627-11e6-8048-245cec4fc43d.png</a>"></p>

<p>Not for the faint hearted – this one is the real deal, where you jump without any attachments and free fall. It is one of the most challenging experiences of skydiving in India.</p>

<p>Note: Obviously given the serious nature of this skydive, it requires both classroom instructions and practical training and is done from at least 13000 feet.
So, which one is your pick? Hold on your breath daredevils ’cause you could go skydiving in India now!</p>

<p>This surely is a tech savvy age and the rise of smartphones are all the rage. It has transformed our society wherein online dating has been ticking all the wrong boxes.
Men who are in relationships might be loyal to their women but nowadays, with this emerging trend of various online dating sites gaining popularity; men are drifting towards infidelity. These online dating sites provide a gamut of attractive facilities to woo men along with hundreds and thousands of eye-catching women waiting to get ticked. Men look for excitement in their lives and what better way than online dating sites? While being in a relationship, there are times when men look for other prospects for simply flirting and passing their time, these online dating sites are a boon for these men to talk with women they have never met or spoken with.</p>

<h2>How to deal with it -</h2>

<p>Do not turn a blind eye to it, if you get acquainted with the fact that your man is getting indulged in online dating sites and is showing his interest in it. It can act like a dagger piercing through the heart but do not ignore.</p>

<h2>Educate yourself and research about his interest –</h2>

<p>If he sends across messages that are steamy and passion then he surely seeks or attention just like an egoistic man would want to do and if he is sending intimate and comforting messages then he is craving for affection emotionally.</p>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324389/86f13aac-c647-11e6-9d6b-94a3f9fef1a1.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324389/86f13aac-c647-11e6-9d6b-94a3f9fef1a1.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>You don’t need to feel that you are not of value for him because online dating is considered as a sign of infidelity and such men at times lack the ability of communicating their needs or it might even be the reason of his self-image. You need to reach out to him and talk it out instead of thinking about anything else.</p>

<h2>Set your limits –</h2>

<p>When you get to know that your man is cheating on you, you need to set your limits there and then. Stop acting like an emotional freak and if you are serious for him; make it certain that he needs to make a choice. Don’t feel the pain of his entertainment and cut all ties of physical intimacy till the time he doesn’t get back to his senses.</p>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324390/86fe7244-c647-11e6-989f-b3c925bc419d.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324390/86fe7244-c647-11e6-989f-b3c925bc419d.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Don’t burst like a volcano over him and try to be calm. Because he might take offence despite being wrong at his part. Also, don’t blame or argue, put out your heart on your sleeve and refrain from having any physical contact with him. He might comprehend the blunder he has made to his relationship.</p>

<h2>Focus back on your life –</h2>

<p>Your happiness is equally important and if you cannot control his infidelity, be kind to yourself. Do not indulge in sleepless nights and swollen eyes. Pamper yourself and ignore his behavior. There are times when your self-esteem gets broken when your man does such things.</p>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324388/86e47ef2-c647-11e6-87fe-e9e744e0fe2a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324388/86e47ef2-c647-11e6-87fe-e9e744e0fe2a.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Bubble-up and make sure you date yourself and spend as much time with yourself that it makes you feel happy. Take your life back and maintain the respect and self-esteem in the ego, no matter what. Everything else will fall back into place and if he is meant to be, he will come back to you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299213/73ec5474-c5bf-11e6-8840-1807723aa1df.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299213/73ec5474-c5bf-11e6-8840-1807723aa1df.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>It sends shivers down your spine when you acknowledge or even think about your beau cheating on you. Trust and faith are the base of any relationship. There are a few tests and ways through which you can check the loyalty of your boyfriend. There are times when you might be apprehensive of his behavior like phone number on waiting, replying late or reluctant to meet but it does not mean that he is cheating on you. Suspecting him for false reasons might be a disastrous feeling for your relationship so try to test him through the below mentioned ways.</p>

<h2>Steer clear from infidelity</h2>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299210/73e10b6e-c5bf-11e6-8ccd-77cfac469d6a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299210/73e10b6e-c5bf-11e6-8ccd-77cfac469d6a.jpg</a>">
You don’t have to hire a company to do the loyalty test for you. Start small and conduct loyalty tests all by yourself. You don’t have to involve scores of people to do this for you when some simple tricks can do the work for you.</p>

<h2>The Social Media Test</h2>

<p>You need to develop a fake social media profile with a believable name along with photographs and friends so that it doesn’t look unreliable. The pictures that you post, make sure that those pictures are attractive and might woo your guy. Try to flirt and trifle with him. Try to judge his reply and check, if he is interested in that fake profile. Slowly and steadily ask for his number and check whether he reverts or not. If he is interested in that fake profile and shares the phone number then, he is certainly not trustworthy and you have proof to support the infidelity.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299209/73dd5a96-c5bf-11e6-9828-fd802570b6a0.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299209/73dd5a96-c5bf-11e6-9828-fd802570b6a0.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>Friends with Benefits</h2>

<p>Take help from your friends and make them meet your guy. Try to observe his behavior and attributes while he communicates with your friends. Ask one of your friend to become overfriendly and informal with your guy and check his response. You don’t have to exaggerate the situation, ask your friend to call and flirt with him. Just in case if he is positive towards the entire philandering then he is surely not loyal.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299212/73e5773a-c5bf-11e6-9723-8f05fa70c8d1.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299212/73e5773a-c5bf-11e6-9723-8f05fa70c8d1.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>Sudden change in attitude</h2>

<p>Try to observe his behavior, way of dressing, talking and meeting you. Is he ignoring you while giving you a reason of work overload or does he spend a lot of time surfing social media? These are some of the things which might be of concern for you. Does he not share his messages with you or he doesn’t like if you check his cell phone or Facebook account?
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299211/73e1d198-c5bf-11e6-8ae4-0421f8ff1b80.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299211/73e1d198-c5bf-11e6-8ae4-0421f8ff1b80.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>These are some of the ways through which you can confront your boyfriend and check whether he is loyal to you or not. You never know if he is a two-timing man or he has been cheating on you since a long time. You have to be frank and do not allow him to twist the things. If you are serious for him, try to confront it and work on your relationship. This would take time to heal because it can develop grudges between the two of you but time heals every wound. Give him a last chance but always remember that once bitten, twice shy; stay cautious and guarded.</p>

Well, your footwear is a mirror of your style sense. So, I suggest pair your outfit and jewelry with nice traditional footwear like kolhapuri chapples,
jodhpuri or mojadi. You can also go with nice pair of flipflops with designs and glittery stones.</p>

<h1>Get trendy with long skirts:</h1>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19651460/8a2c1fbe-9a2a-11e6-83dd-c79aefb93842.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19651460/8a2c1fbe-9a2a-11e6-83dd-c79aefb93842.jpg</a>">
Do you have collection of ethnic tops and jackets? Then team up those with any vibrant colored long skirt. But make sure not to go with
very flowy or dramatic skirts as it can mess with diyas or rangoli.</p>

<h1>Stylish nose ring:</h1>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19651466/8a8718ce-9a2a-11e6-8cd7-eb9674c2f9e2.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19651466/8a8718ce-9a2a-11e6-8cd7-eb9674c2f9e2.jpg</a>">
Though it’s very less considered armament in jewelry, Stylish nose ring can gives you elegant look for this Diwali. You can find various kinds of nose ring or studs with different material like metal,
stone, gold etc.</p>
