A compact or what is commonly known as face powder is the most common thing that a girl must have in her makeup kit. This is essential as the normal Indian skin is oily. Therefore, putting on a loose or translucent powder on, the skin would not look too oily after a couple of years.</p>

<h1>Primer</h1>

Foundation is another essential item that is meant for a makeup girl. When applied, it acts as a base glow for your skin.</p>

<h1>Eye-liner</h1>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813009/3000fbb2-8306-11e6-873d-4fdec1d7d180.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813009/3000fbb2-8306-11e6-873d-4fdec1d7d180.jpg</a>" width="400" height="500">

<p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<h1>Why do you spend so much time on makeup?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813011/300899ee-8306-11e6-88a2-16ea09db0b3e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813011/300899ee-8306-11e6-88a2-16ea09db0b3e.jpg</a>" width="600" height="500">
Often, most of the girls are seen with little or too much makeup on. There is hardly any girl who does not likes to put on makeup in order to look good. So, this can be one of the questions that a guy would probably want to ask her girl that why does she spend so much time on doing makeup. And the answer would be because the girls like the way they look in it. Also, it is fun to wear makeup.</p>

<h1>How frequently do you talk bad about your friends?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813008/2fee873e-8306-11e6-8ee1-2aa132311b0a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813008/2fee873e-8306-11e6-8ee1-2aa132311b0a.jpg</a>">
There is a difference between gossiping about someone and talking bad about them. Gossip can be harmless but talking bad can be something serious. So, another question that a guy would like to ask his girl is that does she talk bad about her friends. To be frank, the ones whom one calls her friend, she can never talk bad about him or her.</p>

<h1>Do you watch porn? If yes, how often?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813009/3000fbb2-8306-11e6-873d-4fdec1d7d180.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813009/3000fbb2-8306-11e6-873d-4fdec1d7d180.jpg</a>">
This one got to be another question that would interest a guy. He might want to ask this to her girlfriend if she also enjoys watching porn and how often does she watches them. well, the answer can be most of them don’t even like to think of doing this. This is because girls are more of mental than visual. They believe in imagination and storyline, so watching such poorly acted video might not be their thing.</p>

<h1>Why do you take so much time while taking a shower?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813012/300bd708-8306-11e6-8ce2-593994244b55.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813012/300bd708-8306-11e6-8ce2-593994244b55.jpg</a>">
It is found that many girls take a lot of time in bathing. So, the guy is always inquisitive to know that what makes his girl also spend so much time in bathing.</p>

<h1>What would you say about No shave November?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19012722/24349d3c-87db-11e6-8feb-199618ef89e7.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19012722/24349d3c-87db-11e6-8feb-199618ef89e7.jpg</a>">
There is no denying the fact that girls also need to shave certain areas of their body, where it is inevitable. But like the boys it is very common that girls feel lazy about this too. So, this one would definitely make a guy pose a question on her girly.</p>

<h1>What habit/habits do you hate in your guy?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813010/30039124-8306-11e6-8adc-0859f99f37ae.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813010/30039124-8306-11e6-8adc-0859f99f37ae.jpg</a>">
Well, this one would be a beneficial question for every guy. If they dare to ask the bad habits in them that their girl hates and wants them to change, it would somewhere do good to them as well as their relationship, provided that the girl answers honestly.</p>

<h1>Do you like to check out other guys just for an eye candy?</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19012723/249edd32-87db-11e6-94a2-917ac0edaf9d.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19012723/249edd32-87db-11e6-94a2-917ac0edaf9d.jpg</a>">
Yet another question that every guy would rush on is that how often do their girlfriend checks out other guys for providing an eye candy to themselves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813044/82b6d6a0-8307-11e6-9a62-386a7c5b5470.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813044/82b6d6a0-8307-11e6-9a62-386a7c5b5470.jpg</a>" width="400" height="500">
Getting confused between liking someone and loving her is a very normal thing. Most of the guys take years to realize that they love a girl or it is just a cute little crush that they have on them. In fact, many a times it happens so that even after coming into a relationship, they are confused about whether they love her or they just have a crush on her. To clear this confusion a little bit, here is a small attempt that would make you realize the difference between love and crush:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Temporary feeling:</h1>

<p>Crush is temporary feeling. It is nothing but attraction. If you have a crush on a girl, you will only have such a feeling when the girl is around you. When she is not around, you would not feel anything like attraction but in case of love, you will their presence in every moment of your life.</p>

<h1>Priority</h1>

<p>When you love someone, she would be your priority and you would value her more than yourselves. Sometimes, you would even do anything or go anywhere for her, without even giving a second thought to it but in case of crush, you would not have that much of guts to do ‘anything’ for her. Somewhere, you will resist taking the risk.</p>

<h1>On your mind, all the time</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813077/6988c584-8308-11e6-9670-9cf2b13c6603.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813077/6988c584-8308-11e6-9670-9cf2b13c6603.png</a>">
You will like your life to be filled with her memories, when you love a girl. Perhaps, you would feel her right, even if she is wrong at some point. Her behavior would not change even an inch of your love for her. Also, you would remember each and every moment you spend or spent with her but in case of crush, you would only start to think of her when someone talks about her to you or she appears in front of you.</p>

<h1>Their happiness makes you happy</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813075/69758de8-8308-11e6-857b-d1ca929128da.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813075/69758de8-8308-11e6-857b-d1ca929128da.jpg</a>">
When you love a girl, her happiness would make you happier than yours  but if it is just a mere crush, you would feel happy for them but prioritize your happiness.</p>

<h1>Hard to forget</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813076/697b1420-8308-11e6-8abb-ad4d6b607cbb.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18813076/697b1420-8308-11e6-8abb-ad4d6b607cbb.jpg</a>" width="500" height="600">
If you truly love her, it would be hard to forget her after she is gone. You might take her out of your life but you can never take her out of your mind as well as heart. You will feel her in everyone you come across but crush fades away with the passage of time and as the person moves away from your life.</p>

<h1>What she feels, bothers you</h1>

<p>When you are in love with a girl, you are affected by what she likes or dislikes, what are her desires, or what interests her the most. All these things would keep on rolling in your mind even if she has left you. On the contrary, when you have a crush on a girl, you would attempt to know her likes and dislikes and what other feelings she has but that would be for a short period of time. The moment you stop receiving a response since long, it would hardly bother you.</p>
