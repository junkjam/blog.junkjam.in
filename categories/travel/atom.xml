Solang Valley
Located 15kms above Manali lies Solang valley. At this place, one can find adventures in tranquillity. Solang valley, indeed, is dangerously beautiful with lots of ups and downs. This place comes on the way to Rohtang pass and like the state itself, this place is love for people who have visited for adventure, trekking or just to feel stillness of the nature. Let it be summer season or winter weather, it is a perfect sight to see..!!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It is beautiful and it can be defined in this way:</p>

<h3>Sports:</h3>

<p>Steep slope of Solang valley makes it perfect for Skiing, but this facility is offered in winter only.</p>

<p>Skiing is replaced by Zorbing in summer- It starts somewhere from the month of May. Zorbing, if you have no idea about, is an adventure activity done in the steep slopes. It is done in huge ball with capacity of 2 people to go inside and it is rolled down from hills with distance of 200 meters.</p>

<p>Paragliding, well personally I would define it as watching hills while flying like bird. It is one hell of an experience, moment of adrenaline rush mixed with excitement of flying.
{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/42999243-9dc84152-8c3a-11e8-8438-5f3cce071e02.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/42999243-9dc84152-8c3a-11e8-8438-5f3cce071e02.jpg</a> 500 600 %}</p>

<p>Lately, cable car has been introduced which will carry people to the height of 2200 meters allowing them to glide from there.
There is provision of Rope crossings as there is water flowing amid the rocks and Bungee Jumping too.</p>

<h3>Price:</h3>

<h4>Paragliding (1500mts): INR 1500</h4>

<h4>Paragliding (2500 mts and above): INR 3200 (including the charges of cable car)</h4>

<p>Zorbing, Bungee jumping, River crossing: INR 400 each or INR 800 for all (depending on your bargaining skills)
There are other fun activities too, like Paint balls which cost INR 100/person.</p>

<h3>Stay:</h3>

<p>{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/42999237-96863476-8c3a-11e8-8f3e-966c0bd7514c.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/42999237-96863476-8c3a-11e8-8f3e-966c0bd7514c.jpg</a> 500 600 %}
A night stay in camp is always in the plan of travellers. Well, Solang Valley will not leave you disappointed in this arena too. The valley becomes too silent at night left with only few tourist and workers over there.
Though the number of camps above are too less, you can do booking before reaching or you can directly go and book, depending on the season. There are happykampers people, who give the best facility in the area and booking can be done one <a rel="nofollow" href="http://happykampers.in/" target="_blank">happykampers.in</a>. These people provide the best and affordable facility in the area.
Hotels, too, are available.</p>

<h4>Price:</h4>

<p>INR: 1200 for two people.</p>

<h3>Food:</h3>

<p>There are hotels and camp people offering Buffet and Thali both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. But, I would advice to go for Dhabas, if you are a budget traveller.</p>

<h4>Price:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Buffet or Thali: INR 300 (max) per person</li>
<li>Dhaba thali: INR 80-120 per person</li>
</ul>


<h3>Transport:</h3>

<p>People can go be their personal cars or bikes, or rented cabs. However, if you are a budget traveller, use public transport and stay updated about the timings from Bus stand of Manali, which is easily accessible.</p>

<h3>Timing:</h3>

<ul>
<li>From Manali to Solang Valley, it is available at 8:00 a.m./ 12:00 p.m. / 3:00 p.m.</li>
<li>From Solang Valley to Manali, it is available thrice a day i.e. at 10:00 a.m./ 2:00 p.m./ 5:00 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Traveller Tips: Localite or Shop vendors have all the information. It is best to ask them these details</h4>

<h4>Price:</h4>

<p>In case of public tansport, ticket costs around INR 30-40 per head depending on the fuel used in the Vehicle.
If you have rented a cab, the cost varies from season to season and it can vary from INR 1000- 1500 per cab.</p>

<h3>Season:</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>So whatever the reason is, travelling around is on almost everybody’s bucket list. And to experience something different, Solo Travelling is a very romantic idea but not so romantic when comes for safety of women. So, here are some handy safety tips for women who wants to venture alone anywhere, let it be across a state, country or world.</p>

<h3>1.  Research</h3>

<p>Lucky to born in the age of Google, where almost every information is handy. And when you are travelling alone to a new place, u should take care of Cultures, Languages, Politcs, how to Dress, Food, Scam and where to stay. When you are booking a hotel or hostel in advance, go by the review. Never book a hotel or place without reading reviews or when no review is mentioned. It will not only just help you to stay away from danger but also will not let you miss anything.
{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559142-fc0fc394-2a46-11e8-8aee-ce4fdf391175.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559142-fc0fc394-2a46-11e8-8aee-ce4fdf391175.jpg</a> %}</p>

<h3>2.  Hyper-aware</h3>

<p>Stay aware about your surroundings, if anyone is following you or a person watching you regularly or a car is halting continuously behind you. Stay cautious to footsteps, shadow or people coming near you. Change the lanes suddenly. Never update on Social Media in real time about your location, do it once you have left the place.
{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559138-d83fb226-2a46-11e8-8ba7-bde28e74c916.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559138-d83fb226-2a46-11e8-8ba7-bde28e74c916.jpg</a> %}</p>

<h3>3.  Packing</h3>

<p>Do not pack all your important documents and cash at single place. Distribute it in 2-3 pouch, purse or pocket of the bag. Keep secret cash for emergency. Always carry the Xeroxed documents when you are travelling through the city, lock the original one in the hotel room where you are staying.
{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559141-e85dd228-2a46-11e8-8554-6b1d2510f46c.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559141-e85dd228-2a46-11e8-8554-6b1d2510f46c.jpg</a> %}</p>

<h3>4.  Interacting</h3>

<p>Refer women for directions or place. If travelling by public transport, sit beside a woman, if ladies coach is not available. Prefer hiring a private taxi in the strange city. Strangers could be good as well as bad so always trust your guts.  Lie if necessary. If feeling lost, do not let it come on your face, fake it till you make it.
{% img center <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559155-0f8b9b8c-2a47-11e8-8a3a-692094afa5c2.jpg">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37187282/37559155-0f8b9b8c-2a47-11e8-8a3a-692094afa5c2.jpg</a> %}</p>

<h3>5.  Contacts</h3>

<p>Always keep updated your friends and family about your whereabouts, with so much of technology flooding around, keep sending them your locations. Keep a note of a friend or a family member who could be contacted at the time of emergency. If travelling overseas, register on embassy, they will act like POC of your family.
