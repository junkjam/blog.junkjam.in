    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif</a>">
Break ups can be very difficult to deal with and looking at how fast paced our lives are, it is difficult to make time for you and cope up with all the depression phase.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Needless to talk about how you have to deal with all the people around who if know about the break up, keep asking how you feeling and those who don’t know keep wondering
if there is something wrong you are going through mentally. However, we have got a few ways in which you can handle a break up without going through much of self- disappointment or depression.
Hope this tips help you and do the best for you</p>

<h1>Block him or unfriend him from all social media platforms.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104511/8a2b50b4-8afa-11e6-9cc1-5252742b2490.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104511/8a2b50b4-8afa-11e6-9cc1-5252742b2490.gif</a>">
You might feel like a grownup that does not need to do all this but trust us, this helps BIG time! Off course you do not what his name popping up in your notifications. This might keep reminding you of him and plus getting updates about what he is up to while are trying to move on can worsen things up for you.</p>

<h1>Do not jump into the ‘let us just be friends’ stage too soon.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104513/8a3137f4-8afa-11e6-95b4-262e04c3a847.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104513/8a3137f4-8afa-11e6-95b4-262e04c3a847.gif</a>">
It is advisable to give yourself sometime to figure things out and realize what needs to be changed and what does not. If he suggests this then tell him that you need some time to think about it. Usually one wish to be just friends while the other expects more out of it, and at such you a state, you might want to have things clear and no confusions involved.</p>

<h1>If you are ever tempted to drink, take a friend along.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104510/8a288564-8afa-11e6-9ee7-b4d811ee0964.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104510/8a288564-8afa-11e6-9ee7-b4d811ee0964.gif</a>">
Drinking while you are alone and sad after a break up is very common.Although some find it a convenient way to deal with such traumatic situations, it is not really a solution to it. If you are tempted to go for a drink, take a trusted friend along who would make sure you don’t up making regrettable choices when you are drunk.</p>

<h1>Start up an intense work out regime.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104512/8a2c681e-8afa-11e6-8e6c-81d934bc15db.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104512/8a2c681e-8afa-11e6-8e6c-81d934bc15db.gif</a>">
You might have come across options like these which people usually choose. The point is to boost your self-confidence and keep you focus on your own well-being. Moreover, doing something such as kickboxing is a great way of getting all the inner frustration out and doing something productive.</p>

<h1>Allow yourself to cry whenever you need to.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif</a>">
This one can be a bit confusing but letting it all go and getting yourself out of the phase should be your motive.</p>

<p>Most importantly give time to do things that you like doing and being around people who love and care for you.
Before loving others, it is important to love ourselves, beginnings could be little difficult but once you start initiating things, you feel good about it. Remember the solution is always live up in the present than recalling the past. Your life is important.</p>

Dating online is no more a taboo. It has become a pretty normal way of finding dating partners. Not to miss out some relationships that turned into having a bright future.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Online dating can be a very tricky business. While it can work wonders for a few, it can even become troublesome for others. Under such circumstances, one must be self-informed about everything that goes around.
Not all online experiences turn out to be good ones and thus, here are a few tips which will help you connect to a partner suitable for you and also help you avoid making silly mistakes:</p>

<h1>Select a good site.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020016/39b50720-88ba-11e6-8e6a-7a36570515e0.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020016/39b50720-88ba-11e6-8e6a-7a36570515e0.jpg</a>">
Even before you start dreaming about your to-be date; it is necessary to give enough time to select an appropriate site for online dating. While there are sites which allow you to make choice for yourself from a number of members using the same website, there are also sites that suggest dates to you based on your compatibility.
If you wish to have the freedom of choice and are ready to go through hundreds of accounts, then the prior one is what you should be looking for.</p>

<h1>Choose someone with similar interests.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020012/25cb172c-88ba-11e6-8221-7356013943f9.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020012/25cb172c-88ba-11e6-8221-7356013943f9.jpg</a>">
If you are specific about what you are looking for, for example, of a particular community or work place or a defined age group or even in terms of preferred sexuality, there exist sites which work wholly based on that particular category.
This way it will be much more sorted, easier and faster. Also while choosing a partner; people like to usual go for someone with whom they share similar interest. This helps you to start a good conversation.</p>

<h1>Not being too choosy is the key.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020014/31813178-88ba-11e6-8acb-5611f4cd88d4.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19020014/31813178-88ba-11e6-8acb-5611f4cd88d4.jpg</a>">
It is a human tendency to make a list of have’s and have not’s when you start talking to each other or meet on the first date. You might have thoughts like ‘he doesn’t dress well’ or ‘she does not have good eyes’ or ‘he does not earn enough’.
However, when you are going for online dating, it is very important to have an open mind and not to be too much judgmental about everything. Letting your inner voice stay at peace and seeing what’s kept on the plate for you is a wise choice. You might as well turn out to like the person.</p>

<h1>Be honest.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19019984/1b259cf8-88b9-11e6-88ad-4a78b058f81a.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19019984/1b259cf8-88b9-11e6-88ad-4a78b058f81a.gif</a>">
The truth can’t be denied that it is very tempting to exaggerate or stretch things while writing your bio. Nevertheless, lying can lead to a number of disappointments in the future. It is best to stay honest since the start and have nothing to hide about.
False revealing can make you lose a potential partner. Not pretending or trying to be someone or something you are not is the best option to go for.</p>

<p>Online dating has become a fade lately because of which it has become very important to beware aboutpeople who use these sites for their selfish needs or to trick people. One ‘must’ stand by rule is to keep it low at the start. Do not give too many details.
Rest is all that your personality and charms needs to manage.</p>
