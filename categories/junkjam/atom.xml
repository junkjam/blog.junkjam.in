    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378807/4b4d9c26-920c-11e6-97de-2fb444f62545.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378807/4b4d9c26-920c-11e6-97de-2fb444f62545.gif</a>" width="500" height="600">
Well, it is not as if the number of questions we often bombard you with is a low figure. Nevertheless, we have a few more.
There are certain questions, which are not so easy to ask, or are better avoided. However, in alignment with our traits,
we cannot feel at peace unless these questions are answered.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>No matter how cool we might seem as girlfriends, we remain troubled by these questions.
Therefore, boys, if you are reading this, please do help us clear away the clouds of curiosity hovering over our heads by answering these questions!</p>

<h1>1.Do you love me? Like, you really do?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378810/4b5135d4-920c-11e6-9819-b7f47d541d5c.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378810/4b5135d4-920c-11e6-9819-b7f47d541d5c.gif</a>">
You might have been very clear about your serious intentions. Yet, we feel the need to re-confirm if the answer has changed, is still the same, or is modified.
And of course, we love listening to the way you express your love.</p>

<h1>2.How much do you love me?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378794/4b17ec2a-920c-11e6-8e48-76543db03aea.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378794/4b17ec2a-920c-11e6-8e48-76543db03aea.gif</a>">
We aren’t expecting a very clichéd answer for this one, but rather an honest answer that quantitatively describes your love for us.
Then you can probably just add on those historic lines proclaiming how you can even fetch us stars from Heaven. :P</p>

<h1>3.‘Do you ever stalk me the way I stalk you?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378807/4b4d9c26-920c-11e6-97de-2fb444f62545.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378807/4b4d9c26-920c-11e6-97de-2fb444f62545.gif</a>">
Umm, maybe not as diligently as we do, but at least partially in the same manner that we do?
That’s really something we girls would want to know. We love knowing how much a person is curious about us.</p>

<h1>4.Does your best friend really like us?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378797/4b195eca-920c-11e6-8d2a-09695430c5d2.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378797/4b195eca-920c-11e6-8d2a-09695430c5d2.gif</a>">
If this question has not yet come up, be assured that it soon will. Although your best friend might be very nice to us,
we cannot help but contemplate on the question if she genuinely likes us or is being pretentious and doing it for the sake of friendship.</p>

<h1>5.‘How serious were you in your previous relationship?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378798/4b1af94c-920c-11e6-8787-0feccfb25de8.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378798/4b1af94c-920c-11e6-8787-0feccfb25de8.gif</a>">
This kind of a question may lead to an awkward silence. It is similar to the awkwardness we face when we contemplate asking you this.
The answer would not really affect our relationship, but we are curious. We would want to be a bit more knowledgeable about this.</p>

<h1>6.‘Did you ever imagine getting married to your ex?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378796/4b18c352-920c-11e6-8118-fd9083e9c858.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378796/4b18c352-920c-11e6-8118-fd9083e9c858.gif</a>">
If it were a straight forward NO, we definitely would want to know the answer. However, if it’s a yes, then maybe we should just go to the next question.</p>

<h1>7. ‘What do your friends think about me?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378811/4b51c6b6-920c-11e6-9198-180e93ff30d0.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378811/4b51c6b6-920c-11e6-9198-180e93ff30d0.gif</a>">
Whether the answer is negative or positive, we are ready to face anything and everything.
We just want to know about the kind of conversation you have with your friends while discussing us.</p>

<h1>8.‘Do you still miss something special about your past relationship?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378799/4b1fccc4-920c-11e6-8dd9-f1519d838bbb.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378799/4b1fccc4-920c-11e6-8dd9-f1519d838bbb.gif</a>">
At some point, we do accept your past and stay cool with it. Yet, we do love keeping ourselves informed about such things.</p>

<h1>9.What if your parents do not accept me?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378814/4b52a34c-920c-11e6-88c1-1175cd81b92b.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378814/4b52a34c-920c-11e6-88c1-1175cd81b92b.gif</a>">
We reassure you that we will try our best to make them like us.
However, suppose they don’t, what do we do then? Where does our relationship go from here?</p>

<h1>10.Why me at all?’</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378795/4b1756b6-920c-11e6-8677-5966d4dc2bf0.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19378795/4b1756b6-920c-11e6-8677-5966d4dc2bf0.gif</a>">
Now this one calls for a super romantic reply. We girls would love hearing about your feelings during the initial meeting, and what prompted you to choose us.
It might be the hundredth time but it is hard to explain how it feels to hear the answer every single time!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268109/08a047c2-8fd0-11e6-9f5a-a0f67ae52f96.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268109/08a047c2-8fd0-11e6-9f5a-a0f67ae52f96.jpg</a>" width="500" height="500">
A girl’s wedding is the most important day of her life and everything related to wedding needs to be absolutely amazing. Moreover, the tiny minis associated that give immense happiness and one such happiness is the fun of doing your own wedding shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It is that time of your life when you can buy anything and nobody can stop you. Just imagine how exciting would be the shopping for wedding makeup. But a wise thing to do would be that you buy only those products that you will actually use as cosmetics expire after a certain period of time. Nonetheless, we have some essentials that would make a perfect wedding vanity box for you.</p>

<h1>Compact</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210349/486f457c-8d3e-11e6-94b4-0273f349e085.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210349/486f457c-8d3e-11e6-94b4-0273f349e085.jpg</a>" width="500" height="600">
A compact or what is commonly known as face powder is the most common thing that a girl must have in her makeup kit. This is essential as the normal Indian skin is oily. Therefore, putting on a loose or translucent powder on, the skin would not look too oily after a couple of years.</p>

<h1>Primer</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268109/08a047c2-8fd0-11e6-9f5a-a0f67ae52f96.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268109/08a047c2-8fd0-11e6-9f5a-a0f67ae52f96.jpg</a>" width="600" height="500">
A primer is a must have in your wedding vanity checklist if you love to put on makeup often. This primer acts as a barrier between the foundation and your skin.</p>

<h1>Foundation</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210351/4872c0a8-8d3e-11e6-8c6a-68347ca22be5.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210351/4872c0a8-8d3e-11e6-8c6a-68347ca22be5.jpg</a>">
Foundation is another essential item that is meant for a makeup girl. When applied, it acts as a base glow for your skin.</p>

<h1>Eye-liner</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210347/48692e76-8d3e-11e6-83ab-9223729bf307.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210347/48692e76-8d3e-11e6-83ab-9223729bf307.jpg</a>">
This is another makeup thing that you must carry in your kit. It outlines your eyes.</p>

<h1>Brush</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210352/48a7f9d0-8d3e-11e6-89ae-f92b24c904c2.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210352/48a7f9d0-8d3e-11e6-89ae-f92b24c904c2.jpg</a>">
A brush is required to put makeup on. Hence, you can include different brushes according to the purpose they are meant for.</p>

<h1>Eye-shadow</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210348/486e09f0-8d3e-11e6-92d5-8d5f2fc78e05.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210348/486e09f0-8d3e-11e6-92d5-8d5f2fc78e05.jpg</a>">
Putting a light shade of shadow on your eyes would make them look attractive and ‘eye-catchy.’</p>

<h1>Mascara</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268125/229ec05e-8fd0-11e6-975d-6ce9f4d5bc0d.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/19268125/229ec05e-8fd0-11e6-975d-6ce9f4d5bc0d.png</a>" width="500" height="600">
This serves as a magical equipment in your makeup box and makes your eye lashes look simply amazing.</p>

<h1>Lipstick and Lip liner</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210353/48ab9914-8d3e-11e6-8d6a-20fbf7713e16.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210353/48ab9914-8d3e-11e6-8d6a-20fbf7713e16.jpg</a>">
Although a lipstick or a lip-gloss is more or less the same thing but the choice entirely depends upon you. In fact, you can go for both of them but do not forget to assist them with a lip liner as it outlines your lips, with lipstick or gloss filled in. You can have as many shades and colors of lipsticks or glosses you want to.</p>

<h1>Kajal Pencil</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210350/4871b654-8d3e-11e6-8924-5b61b2236530.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210350/4871b654-8d3e-11e6-8924-5b61b2236530.jpg</a>">
When you have already equipped your kit with an eyeliner, how can you forget a kajal pencil. Kajal is something that is being used since ages by the women folk and it is believed to give your eyes a magical look. They say kajal is the most basic makeup that a girl can put on.</p>

<h1>Eyebrow Pencil</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210346/4866ca00-8d3e-11e6-9fba-8e0df2f38a40.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210346/4866ca00-8d3e-11e6-9fba-8e0df2f38a40.jpg</a>" width="500" height="600">

<h1>Concealer</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210355/48b306cc-8d3e-11e6-8a85-72850d857d43.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/19210355/48b306cc-8d3e-11e6-8a85-72850d857d43.jpg</a>" width="500" height="600">

You might feel like a grownup that does not need to do all this but trust us, this helps BIG time! Off course you do not what his name popping up in your notifications. This might keep reminding you of him and plus getting updates about what he is up to while are trying to move on can worsen things up for you.</p>

<h1>Do not jump into the ‘let us just be friends’ stage too soon.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104513/8a3137f4-8afa-11e6-95b4-262e04c3a847.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104513/8a3137f4-8afa-11e6-95b4-262e04c3a847.gif</a>">
It is advisable to give yourself sometime to figure things out and realize what needs to be changed and what does not. If he suggests this then tell him that you need some time to think about it. Usually one wish to be just friends while the other expects more out of it, and at such you a state, you might want to have things clear and no confusions involved.</p>

<h1>If you are ever tempted to drink, take a friend along.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104510/8a288564-8afa-11e6-9ee7-b4d811ee0964.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104510/8a288564-8afa-11e6-9ee7-b4d811ee0964.gif</a>">
Drinking while you are alone and sad after a break up is very common.Although some find it a convenient way to deal with such traumatic situations, it is not really a solution to it. If you are tempted to go for a drink, take a trusted friend along who would make sure you don’t up making regrettable choices when you are drunk.</p>

<h1>Start up an intense work out regime.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104512/8a2c681e-8afa-11e6-8e6c-81d934bc15db.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104512/8a2c681e-8afa-11e6-8e6c-81d934bc15db.gif</a>">
You might have come across options like these which people usually choose. The point is to boost your self-confidence and keep you focus on your own well-being. Moreover, doing something such as kickboxing is a great way of getting all the inner frustration out and doing something productive.</p>

<h1>Allow yourself to cry whenever you need to.</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21153184/19104514/8a579746-8afa-11e6-8881-f7a1c00d0160.gif</a>">
This one can be a bit confusing but letting it all go and getting yourself out of the phase should be your motive.</p>

<p>Most importantly give time to do things that you like doing and being around people who love and care for you.
Before loving others, it is important to love ourselves, beginnings could be little difficult but once you start initiating things, you feel good about it. Remember the solution is always live up in the present than recalling the past. Your life is important.</p>
