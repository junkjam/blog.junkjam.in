<h1>Evening dress</h1>

Nothing can make you look classier than an elegant yet sexy evening dress. They say red is the color of love so why not put on a red evening dress and have a candle light dinner beneath a sky lit with stars. Pair it with pencil heels and a beige or gold clutch and slay him!</p>

<h1>Floral tunic</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18550456/956e0658-7b71-11e6-8438-a619ff6f4cc4.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18550456/956e0658-7b71-11e6-8438-a619ff6f4cc4.jpg</a>" width="600" height="700">
A tiny tunic makes every girl look pretty and hot at the same time. So, wearing a cute floral dress while going out for shopping would not let him take his eyes off you. Putting on a light and natural makeup would add to the glow on your face and give you that perfect look that would make him love you more and more.</p>

<h1>Boho piece</h1>

A boho one piece is all you need to have that attractive look for your honeymoon. Moreover, it would make your better half go completely crazy after you.</p>

<h1>Hot pants</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18550454/954add72-7b71-11e6-95c6-97a8c9d5d202.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18550454/954add72-7b71-11e6-95c6-97a8c9d5d202.jpg</a>" width="600" height="700">
Hot pants give every girl a sexy chic look. So a denim hot pant wore with a sexy top or a cool tee accompanied by a pair of shades and  wedges would get you a look that would make his eyes glued to you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417590/530a3f42-7852-11e6-9294-5bc2cd9fc9f9.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417590/530a3f42-7852-11e6-9294-5bc2cd9fc9f9.jpg</a>" width="400" height="500">
Wedding! The most auspicious and important day of every girl’s life! On this so very special day, everything ought to be perfect. From a beautiful bridal dress to the perfect background song during the entry, there needs to be sublimity in everything and every girl wants that these dreams come true.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Picture yourself on your wedding day walking down the alley with your favorite people by your side. The marvelous attire and a soft romantic song being played in the background, while you move towards your prince charming. Doesn’t it seem like a fairy tale where you are the princess and the evening belongs to you! So, to help you with this fairy tale turning into reality, we have a list of songs to make your bridal entry an epic one:</p>

<h1>Raabta</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417601/8875089c-7852-11e6-9126-72595dcd31f9.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417601/8875089c-7852-11e6-9126-72595dcd31f9.jpg</a>">
Raabta song from the movie Agent Vinod can be an excellent choice to make the bridal entry a decent yet a grand one! The lyrics of the song, “Kehte Hai Khuda Ne…” perfectly fit the moment, addressing the bride’s and bridegroom’s emotions to each other.</p>

<h1>Din Shagna Da</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417608/ab9a5494-7852-11e6-86e9-a37cd6077c95.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417608/ab9a5494-7852-11e6-86e9-a37cd6077c95.jpg</a>">
I think Din Shagna Da is played at almost every Indian wedding when the beautiful maiden enters. There is hardly any wedding where we won’t hear “din shagna da chadheya” playing in the background, as the bride is stepping towards her to be husband.</p>

<h1>Sajde kiye hai laakhon</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417664/e7174404-7853-11e6-85f8-5e7d181c2eb8.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417664/e7174404-7853-11e6-85f8-5e7d181c2eb8.jpg</a>">
From the legend Akshay Kumar’s movie Khatta Meetha, Sajde kiye hai laakhon is also an ideal and lovely song that can be played at the time of bridal entry. The song is soothing to the ears and would perfectly convey the heart-tendering feelings going on in the hearts of the bridegroom as well as the bride.</p>

<h1>Tum se hi</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417668/0d05ea80-7854-11e6-9f8f-8fb2a24d8fd0.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417668/0d05ea80-7854-11e6-9f8f-8fb2a24d8fd0.jpg</a>">
Another amazing song for a bride’s entry is the song “Tum se hi” from the movie Jab we met. It describes how important both of them feel about each other.</p>

<h1>Teri Ore</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417590/530a3f42-7852-11e6-9294-5bc2cd9fc9f9.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417590/530a3f42-7852-11e6-9294-5bc2cd9fc9f9.jpg</a>">
I think there cannot be a better song that would best describe the moment. As the bride moves towards her better half, the lyrics of the song match every step she takes or each moment she does, while moving forward.</p>

<h1>O Re piya</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/18617466/3d618402-7ded-11e6-94e6-4fc865e880cc.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/18617466/3d618402-7ded-11e6-94e6-4fc865e880cc.jpg</a>">
The song “o re piya” sung by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is good enough to grab people’s attention as and when you enter the venue on your big day.</p>

<h1>Kabira Encore</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417691/a6a4f28a-7854-11e6-9b88-444fff453698.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18417691/a6a4f28a-7854-11e6-9b88-444fff453698.jpg</a>">
Kabira encore version is another wonderful song that can be played well when the bride enters the wedding hall. It makes the atmosphere so senti-menti that the people around start shedding tears looking at the bride.</p>

<h1>Latika’s theme song</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/18617465/3d123bfe-7ded-11e6-9119-a3d8d6c156ce.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/18617465/3d123bfe-7ded-11e6-9119-a3d8d6c156ce.jpg</a>">
Sung by A.R. Rehman, from the movie Slum Dog Millionaire, this theme song is just a feeling that would definitely bring goose bumps on the skin of the listeners. The more you listen to this, the more you will feel it and love it.</p>

<p>So girls , on your big day, don’t let the DJs ruin your eye-catching entry by playing some cheap beats. Choose your own jingle for your special day!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250508/6ecce898-73a1-11e6-918f-451afab578b6.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250508/6ecce898-73a1-11e6-918f-451afab578b6.jpg</a>" width="400" height="500">
When it comes to choosing the Bridal Lehenga, we just never mind the thousands of rupees as well as the long hours spent in finalizing the same. We take extra initiative to customize it according to our preference and make it more attractive in every way possible. But what happens of that precious piece of clothing, the bridal lehenga , after the wedding. Well if I am not wrong, then half of my readers will raise their hand if I say its wrapped up in a malmal ka kapda safely in the wardrobe. Well here are some great ideas to re use your bridal lehenga in a classy fashion again and again.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Lessen the volume and Cut it along.</h1>

<p>Though it may sound very harsh and painful but one can surely lessen down the motifs and heavy embellishments by simply cutting it off and toning it down in its look. With the extra kalis removed which was forcefully inserted at that time or event with the net out it will look more subtle and wearable.
<img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250132/b938d0c4-739f-11e6-8ae8-f779a4d6da8a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250132/b938d0c4-739f-11e6-8ae8-f779a4d6da8a.jpg</a>"></p>

<h1>Switch the style to Anarkali</h1>

<p>With the help of a good tailor, its quite easy to transform your wedding attire to an embellished anarkali which looks less bridal in comparison to a bridal lehenga. The skirt and the blouse can be stitched together with a waist belt or the same can be stitched with a separate simpler blouse to get the desired effect.

<h1>Long Kurtis with Lehengas</h1>

This is one of the most preferred styles that have hit the fashion world with a bang. And it is also a great way to reuse the bridal lehenga with a toned kurti and set the look. Even jackets with thin borders are also a good option to try along.</p>

<h1>Combining the bridal set with other attires</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg</a>">
Usually the bridal lehenga teamed up with designer blouses and embellished dupatta forms the bridal set and altogether they provide the bridal feel. So the best way is to team the lehenga with a toned top, wear the blouse with a plain skirt and use the dupatta with a neutral shaded salwar kameez.</p>

<h1>Color Blocks</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250285/73bdf9e2-73a0-11e6-8379-7be272a1b291.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250285/73bdf9e2-73a0-11e6-8379-7be272a1b291.jpg</a>">
It is not always necessary to team up bridal lehenga with same colored blouses. Color blocking is quite in the fashion so if the idea is to attend some wedding function then pair up the embellished lehenga with a no work blouse of different color and just set the elegant look for the occasion.</p>

<h1>Drape it as a saree</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/18250339/aaba739e-73a0-11e6-8b2f-a31b13861729.jpg</a>">
There are many cases when the lehenga sets have a long flowing dupatta with loads of zari work on it. The best way to tone the dress down and still keep the charm is to drape the dupatta as a saree pallu and use a toned down blouse to maintain the classy look</p>

<h1>Use as it is</h1>

<p>We all love our lehengas and honestly there are many who just don’t want to alter it. For them the best way to use it is by wearing it just as it is but with a simpler accessories, toned make up, and by letting the hair fall casually.</p>
