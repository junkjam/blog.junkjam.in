chills setting in slowly, now is the perfect time to lend a brand new spin to your style with
this hot fashion pick.
To help you ease into the trend, here go four stunning variants of the dungaree that you can
opt for. Buckle up, and soak in all the inspiration you can:</p>

<h1>The classic distressed dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643050/571a8b52-617b-11e6-88e2-0577a08b960e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643050/571a8b52-617b-11e6-88e2-0577a08b960e.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Love distressed denims? Take them a notch higher with distressed dungarees that are the
perfect pick for a fun day out with your gal pals. Team them up with this season’s hottest
fashion favourite – cropped tees, and slip into a pair of white oxfords or sneakers to
complete the casual chic look.</p>

<h1>Dungaree shorts</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643049/56ee73dc-617b-11e6-9e46-3e9486348c04.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643049/56ee73dc-617b-11e6-9e46-3e9486348c04.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Showcase your fun side (and, those toned gams) with dungaree shorts that look playfully
flirty! Couple them with a graphic tank top and sneakers to lend just the finishing touch your
look needs. If not denim, pick a printed pair to add a dash of feminine, and swap the
sneakers for strappy sandals!</p>

<h1>Formal black dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643048/56a87468-617b-11e6-8103-d34b1c3eb0b7.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643048/56a87468-617b-11e6-8103-d34b1c3eb0b7.jpg</a>" width="600" height="600">
On your next evening out, ditch the classic cocktail dress and grab a pair of formal black
dungarees to make for some serious power dressing. Wear them over a crisp white shirt,
and a pair of pointy stiletto heels to maintain the perfect balance between formal and</p>

<h1>Layered up</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643051/571b479a-617b-11e6-85e5-5679b30287a0.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643051/571b479a-617b-11e6-85e5-5679b30287a0.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Scarves, jackets, shrugs and even overcoats – dungarees go well with each of the layers,
thereby, giving your look an all new edge. For a casual event, wrap a statement contrast
scarf around your neck and style your hair into a high-rise messy bun. For a formal event, on
the other hand, simply rest your jacket or overcoat on your shoulders and opt for pointy
heels to complete the look.</p>

<p>No longer tricky, are they? Rush now, flaunt your love for dungarees by incorporating trendy
accessories to team them up with, and leave a long-lasting impression on your onlookers.</p>

Though the city malls are quite attractive but in comparison to the charm and attraction of the Delhi street markets, it’s nothing. The most convenient proof of the statement is the overcrowded; jam packed areas of the age old traditional markets of Delhi throughout the year.
One of such a traditional market is the Tibetan Market located on the western side of Janpath.  From designer clothing to stylish accessories, home décor to Tibetan artifacts, footwear to woolen clothes get it all in best quality and that too in throw back prices. Seems unbelievable? Well not, the market is one of the most preferred shopping destinations in the capital city.</p>
