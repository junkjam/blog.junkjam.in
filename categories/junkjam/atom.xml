If a study abroad programme seems appealing to you and you’ve applied or been selected and you are now super-duper excited about the abroad adventure. Well, congratulations! The next step is to prepare yourself for the trip. So make a probable questionnaire and kick start your preparation. Here we have complied 6 must have points in your to-do list while planning your trip.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Passport and Visa</h2>

<p>Without a passport, your abroad trip is impossible. If you already owned one, make sure that it’s not expired or won’t expire within 6 months of your intended return to the place you have opted for study. Also, check with other credentials related to the passport.</p>

<p>For newbies, it’s always advisable to apply for it before you plan a trip because the process may take a little time and also cuts the end-time hassle. One can also apply online, make payment and fix a schedule. It’s the easiest way to apply for a passport these days.</p>

<p>In addition to a passport, a traveller may need a visa to visit his/her dream country. Different countries have different visa requirements. In this regards, you will have to do some research and find out the required list. Or you can approach the nearest embassy as well. Like a passport, visa applications also takes several months to process so delay is non-advisable.</p>

<p>Apart from this, there are few countries, which allow the students to enter without a visa for 90 days. So, if your dream country comes under this umbrella than it’ll be an icing on the cake.</p>

<h2>Ensure You Have a Travel Insurance Plan</h2>

<p>While traveling abroad it is a must that you are covered by an accidental insurance plan.</p>

<p>What are Things that a Travel Insurance Covers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Coverage at the time of flight is delayed/cancelled</li>
<li>Lost luggage</li>
<li>Stolen personal belongings</li>
<li>Evacuation in the case of a health emergency or natural disaster</li>
</ul>


<p>Moreover, you can avail health insurance too from the Council of International Educational Exchange.</p>

<h2>Find a Plane Ticket at Cheapest Price: You’re Lucky</h2>

<p>Finding a plane ticket as per your budget and criteria is like an art of timing and luck. The fares are always unexpected and may vary depending on when you want to fly and to where you want to buy your tickets. There are various agencies though, you can compare the fares as well. Additionally, there are student travel agencies too who offer inexpensive tickets for students travelling abroad. You can approach them too.</p>

<h2>Research Your Destination</h2>

<p>Do some homework before flying to your destination. By knowing briefly about your soon-to-be home’s culture, language, history, economy, geography, you can ease your stay there.</p>

<h2>Settle with the Money</h2>

<p>Get an online account of you don’t have. It will be easier for you to use ATM/debit or credit cards to get cash in the local currency.</p>

<p>Moreover, never forget to inform your current bank that you are flying. Otherwise, you risk getting locked out of your account or they might flag it as a fraud.</p>

<p>Also, get some cash with you and don’t forget it the convert to the required currency. You can find the moneychangers at airport or metro stations.</p>

<h2>Finally Start Packing</h2>

<p>Now come to the last stage when you are done with all the documentations and financial requirements, start packing up. Kindly double check with your airlines to learn their luggage allowances to avoid fees. The less baggage you carry, the lesser are the chances of getting charged.</p>

<p>Finally, prepare yourself mentally, cross check everything that you have packed, especially the documents. Though you can never expect to be fully prepared upon arrival, we hope these tips will help you to plan your trip to your dream destination. Happy flight!!!</p>

<p>In this article, we will give you an idea about how to help your child in choosing the right career path. Moreover, the DO’s and DON’T given here will help you in evaluate your parental role.</p>

<h2>Keep an Eye on these Imperatives:</h2>

<p>There are a few factors, which make the career selection process like a cakewalk. While determining a career for their children, parents should understand and ponder these factors. They include:</p>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375267/567c545e-c752-11e6-8c10-76e9c5ac7c9f.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375267/567c545e-c752-11e6-8c10-76e9c5ac7c9f.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Interest:</h3>

<p>Whatever you are doing, it should be of your interest. Without having an interest in a particular field, one can’t be successful in making this as his/her passion. Same goes to your child too. It is your duty as a parent to keep a frequent check of your child’s interest and choose a career accordingly.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375266/567b37d6-c752-11e6-890d-bb5b43811011.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375266/567b37d6-c752-11e6-890d-bb5b43811011.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Ability:</h3>

<p>One’s ability determines his/her capabilities of doing something. It acts like a mirror of your child personality as well. By noting their ability of doing something, you can select a career exactly meant for your child.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375265/567972e8-c752-11e6-9c3b-1d05801ffc63.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375265/567972e8-c752-11e6-9c3b-1d05801ffc63.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Research on the availability of course:</h3>

<p>The course related to a particular career should be available easily and it is, therefore, parents’ duty to do a thorough research on that before advising their child to opt it.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375264/56789c2e-c752-11e6-9ced-32b230c57a39.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375264/56789c2e-c752-11e6-9ced-32b230c57a39.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Scope:</h3>

<p>Pay attention to the scope of a particular course, which tells us about what type of opportunities, will open up after doing that particular course or going for a career.
<img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375263/5675b1da-c752-11e6-83e4-cc55d58f47b7.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21375263/5675b1da-c752-11e6-83e4-cc55d58f47b7.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Remuneration:</h3>

<p>Though, all the time it’s not necessary, but in today’s scenario, remuneration or salary plays an important role. Remuneration should meet the child’s aspirations, so that they can excel a satisfied and comfortable life ahead.</p>

<h2>Do’s and Don’t</h2>

<h3>Do&rsquo;s</h3>

<ul>
<li>Evaluate your child’s aptitude, strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Help your child in discovering his/her own passion.</li>
<li>Motivate your child in pursuing his/her passion.</li>
<li>Inform your child regarding all aspects of the career.</li>
<li>Help the child understand the work life in the chosen career by associating with professionals in the field.</li>
<li>Stop your child from falling prey to peer-pressure and herd mentality.</li>
<li>Gain your child’s confidence and motivate them to discuss their queries with you.</li>
<li>Seek professional help whenever required.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dont&rsquo;s</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not impose your wish on them</li>
<li>Do not burden the child with unreal expectations</li>
<li>Don’t be impatient when dealing with children</li>
<li>Career scope changes with time; do not try to impose the ideas or views that existed during your days</li>
<li>Do not misguide the child into choosing a career of your choice</li>
<li>Do not be on rush to answer a child’s question without the knowledge. It’s ok to take time, research or seek professional help</li>
<li>Protect your child from being influenced by others in the career selection process</li>
</ul>


<p>This way you can be an active partner of your child while selecting a career. Identify your child’s interest, skills and value and start playing your role.</p>

<p>Happy Parenting</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324391/870c3a8c-c647-11e6-9118-abe61a3cd600.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324391/870c3a8c-c647-11e6-9118-abe61a3cd600.jpg</a>" width="500" height="600"></p>

<p>This surely is a tech savvy age and the rise of smartphones are all the rage. It has transformed our society wherein online dating has been ticking all the wrong boxes.
Men who are in relationships might be loyal to their women but nowadays, with this emerging trend of various online dating sites gaining popularity; men are drifting towards infidelity. These online dating sites provide a gamut of attractive facilities to woo men along with hundreds and thousands of eye-catching women waiting to get ticked. Men look for excitement in their lives and what better way than online dating sites? While being in a relationship, there are times when men look for other prospects for simply flirting and passing their time, these online dating sites are a boon for these men to talk with women they have never met or spoken with.</p>

<h2>How to deal with it -</h2>

<p>Do not turn a blind eye to it, if you get acquainted with the fact that your man is getting indulged in online dating sites and is showing his interest in it. It can act like a dagger piercing through the heart but do not ignore.</p>

<h2>Educate yourself and research about his interest –</h2>

<p>If he sends across messages that are steamy and passion then he surely seeks or attention just like an egoistic man would want to do and if he is sending intimate and comforting messages then he is craving for affection emotionally.</p>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324389/86f13aac-c647-11e6-9d6b-94a3f9fef1a1.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21324389/86f13aac-c647-11e6-9d6b-94a3f9fef1a1.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>You don’t need to feel that you are not of value for him because online dating is considered as a sign of infidelity and such men at times lack the ability of communicating their needs or it might even be the reason of his self-image. You need to reach out to him and talk it out instead of thinking about anything else.</p>

<h2>Set your limits –</h2>

<p>When you get to know that your man is cheating on you, you need to set your limits there and then. Stop acting like an emotional freak and if you are serious for him; make it certain that he needs to make a choice. Don’t feel the pain of his entertainment and cut all ties of physical intimacy till the time he doesn’t get back to his senses.</p>

<p>Don’t burst like a volcano over him and try to be calm. Because he might take offence despite being wrong at his part. Also, don’t blame or argue, put out your heart on your sleeve and refrain from having any physical contact with him. He might comprehend the blunder he has made to his relationship.</p>

<h2>Focus back on your life –</h2>

<p>Your happiness is equally important and if you cannot control his infidelity, be kind to yourself. Do not indulge in sleepless nights and swollen eyes. Pamper yourself and ignore his behavior. There are times when your self-esteem gets broken when your man does such things.</p>

<p>Bubble-up and make sure you date yourself and spend as much time with yourself that it makes you feel happy. Take your life back and maintain the respect and self-esteem in the ego, no matter what. Everything else will fall back into place and if he is meant to be, he will come back to you.</p>

<p>It sends shivers down your spine when you acknowledge or even think about your beau cheating on you. Trust and faith are the base of any relationship. There are a few tests and ways through which you can check the loyalty of your boyfriend. There are times when you might be apprehensive of his behavior like phone number on waiting, replying late or reluctant to meet but it does not mean that he is cheating on you. Suspecting him for false reasons might be a disastrous feeling for your relationship so try to test him through the below mentioned ways.</p>

<h2>Steer clear from infidelity</h2>

<p><img class="center <a lazy" data-original="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299210/73e10b6e-c5bf-11e6-8ccd-77cfac469d6a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/21299210/73e10b6e-c5bf-11e6-8ccd-77cfac469d6a.jpg</a>">
You don’t have to hire a company to do the loyalty test for you. Start small and conduct loyalty tests all by yourself. You don’t have to involve scores of people to do this for you when some simple tricks can do the work for you.</p>

<h2>The Social Media Test</h2>

<p>You need to develop a fake social media profile with a believable name along with photographs and friends so that it doesn’t look unreliable. The pictures that you post, make sure that those pictures are attractive and might woo your guy. Try to flirt and trifle with him. Try to judge his reply and check, if he is interested in that fake profile. Slowly and steadily ask for his number and check whether he reverts or not. If he is interested in that fake profile and shares the phone number then, he is certainly not trustworthy and you have proof to support the infidelity.

<h2>Friends with Benefits</h2>

<p>Take help from your friends and make them meet your guy. Try to observe his behavior and attributes while he communicates with your friends. Ask one of your friend to become overfriendly and informal with your guy and check his response. You don’t have to exaggerate the situation, ask your friend to call and flirt with him. Just in case if he is positive towards the entire philandering then he is surely not loyal.

<h2>Sudden change in attitude</h2>

<p>Try to observe his behavior, way of dressing, talking and meeting you. Is he ignoring you while giving you a reason of work overload or does he spend a lot of time surfing social media? These are some of the things which might be of concern for you. Does he not share his messages with you or he doesn’t like if you check his cell phone or Facebook account?

<p>These are some of the ways through which you can confront your boyfriend and check whether he is loyal to you or not. You never know if he is a two-timing man or he has been cheating on you since a long time. You have to be frank and do not allow him to twist the things. If you are serious for him, try to confront it and work on your relationship. This would take time to heal because it can develop grudges between the two of you but time heals every wound. Give him a last chance but always remember that once bitten, twice shy; stay cautious and guarded.</p>
