Kolkata is the city of joy, where we find many shopping markets to fulfill our shopping needs. This crowded city provides us with many markets like New Market, Gariahat market, Chandni Market etc. In this blog post, we are going to explore in detail about New Market in Kolkata. This market stands on Lindsey Street and was established as a rich arcade to fulfill the shopping requirements of the British-colonist population of the city. As soon as it was opened at the beginning of 1874, it started attracting people from all over India, who spent money in the exclusive shops of this market.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once, British departed this country, New Market had become Indianised. However, its red-brick, ornate exterior still remains British-looking. Its compact clock tower, which rises from its eastern wall, makes us remember the British Empire era.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Inside of New Market you will find a shopping market named S. S. Hawg Market which looks very tangled, however it contains a grid of narrow alleys which are bisecting one another and so many shops and stalls are arranged in neat blocks. You will always find this market busy and crowded and whenever you come at this place, you will find it architecturally chaotic. The boundaries of the market are complicated for defining since it has a basement also, likewise overcrowded with retailers, whose far end seems emerging in another building which contains many more floors of shops. Additionally, of course, the vendors scatter outside the main building and sell their products on the surrounding streets also._</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>We need not to say that you can but absolutely everything here you want. Be it grocery item, fruit and vegetable, meat, fish, toys, toiletries, cosmetics, wigs, sandals, shoes, flowers, electric appliances, kitchen utensils, crockery, crystal, silverware, jewelry, dresses, wallets, bags, scarves, shawls, or suitcases, you can find everything in this incredible street market of Kolkata. Even, you will see astrologer, money-changer and barber shops also in this market.
Well, if you are a bag lover and you are on the search for a handbag in this market, you will get completely confused and will be spoilt for choice, as you will find a million bags on sale here in this great street market.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Entering New Market, you can see not only Indians but also the foreigners who visit this market for shopping regularly. Not only street products, you will find every brand’s outlet in this market, whether it is of dresses or of shoes.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>New Market is not only tourist-friendly; but also the place of foodies as well. Undoubtedly, this place contains the modern shopping malls where you can find top-notch quality products anytime. In a nutshell, this is the place where you can spend your complete weekend, if you are shopaholic and foodie person.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354448/ef0dd216-3ab1-11e6-8ff2-6c7b311dce38.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354448/ef0dd216-3ab1-11e6-8ff2-6c7b311dce38.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="DU Fashion Trends" >
As the new academic session begins, all are busy preparing for their first day of college. Where grooming and fashion is indeed a favourite pass time for all women, Delhi University freshers, as we expect, are all busy in rumbling through their closet to choose their trendiest garments. Market places like Sarojini Nagar, Janpath, lajpat are packed these days with “fuchchas” busy increasing their range of clothes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Delhi University is a dream place for everyone and is known for its trend setting fashion statement. Be it hairstyle, dress, bag, gadgets, shoes or accessories, students will always have something to make heads turn.
Denims and dresses, skirts and shorts, classy chappals, casual flip flops, cool shades and bright bags, remain all time summer favourite for college goers.
DU campus guys, to look outstanding, people usually tattoo on their arms and forehand whereas girls probable choice is back, belly, ankle or foot.</p>

<p>2015 had a lot of fashion hits and these hits are surely coming back. Majority of the trends were inspired from runway shows. In case you’re wondering what would happen this year, just keep reading</p>

<h2>1. Off- Shoulders</h2>

<p>Last year it was really difficult to find an off shoulder dress/top. But since they are coming back this year, the market is going to be full of off-shoulder tops and dresses. They have a bohemian vibe in them. This summer I suggest you to go for off-shoulders instead of crop tops.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>2. Trench Coats</h2>

<p>Definitely the best clothing item for winters. Keeps you warm and looks extremely classy. Forever 21 has one of the best trench coat stock. Instead of going for chunky sweaters, go for trench coats or over sized coats.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>3. Bomber and biker jackets</h2>

<p>I mean just have a look at the pictures.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>4. Ripped Jeans</h2>

<p>When girls came across ripped jeans, they started to hate their normal boring jeans. This year too, they are going to rule. In fact, these jeans cost more than normal jeans.So, I suggest you to DIY your old jeans. It’s pretty simple!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>5. Trimmed Beards</h2>

<p>I know many boys love big beards, but 2016 is not about that. Keeping it neat and classy is the key.Celebrities like Adam Levine and Liam Hemsworth often rock this look and it is sure to be a hit coming seasons.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>6. Strappy Heels and Lug Sole</h2>

<p>Strappy heels are surely sexier than normal pumps / heels. Some day if you feel your outfit is not popping,
Answer?
Strappy heels.
They are not going anywhere till a better type of heel comes into fashion.
Lug soles have this fashion blogger feel in them, making them one of the biggest trends of 2016.Plus they are very comfortable so it’s a win win for everyone.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>7. Denim on Denim</h2>

<p>If you were doing the denim on denim trend in 2015, then my friend you were doing it right.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>8. Baggy Trousers</h2>

<p>They are replacing straight-legged or skinny cuts this winter because they create a whole new silhouette.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg</a>"></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354480/fe455000-3ab2-11e6-8f60-191239f3e4dc.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354480/fe455000-3ab2-11e6-8f60-191239f3e4dc.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>10. Dip DYE, Bronze and Rainbow Hair</h2>

<p>Girls, it’s time to say goodbye to your blonde streaks because 2016 is not at all about that. Dip-dye, ronze (perfect colour for brunettes) and rainbow hair are the most preferred hair colours by Hollywood celebrities. Go fun or go home.</p>

<p>There is plenty to choose from in terms of bed linen, curtains, table cloth, bath mats, shower curtains and a number of other furnishings that bring warmth to a home. Just land up here and look around to find unique gifts for loved ones, dry fruits, tailors who will alter, stitch and dye clothes, stationery for the kids and so on. Unless there is a fixed price sign prominently displayed in the shop, you should surely bargain for better prices and deals everywhere.</p>

<p>Central Market in Lajpat Nagar is a crowded market with numerous lanes, selling ready-made wear, saris, night suits, home textiles, crockery, jewellery and much more. In one of the lanes you will find costume jewellery, ranging from small earrings and jhumkas (chandelier-style danglers) to traditional wedding sets – Thses are ,ofcourse ,all replicas. The bangles are the biggest attraction here. You can get different colors and types of bangles: silver, glass, lacquer, white metal, oxidized silver and plastic. Some of them sport gold, silver, color paint and glass work in intricate patterns. You can match them with necklaces and earrings, even when they are not part of a set. The salesmen are most patient, experienced and updated on modern fashion – they even anticipate your needs. However , you have to be alert and bargain hard as well. The shopkeepers here are willing to bring down the prices substantially,so it is surely worthwhile to bargain. Choodas and kalire for the brides are also available.</p>

<h2>Salwar Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>This lane is parallel to the front row of shops that is opposite to 3Cs Cineplex. The market is perpetually busy and sells stitched and unstitched salwar suits in all kinds of fabrics. The shops stock salwar suits made of cotton, crepe, georgette and other materials. Some have embroidery or simple patterns on them. These suits are good for regular, casual wear, while some do lend themselves to party-wear as well. The patterns are always new and change rapidly. There are tailors and dye shops very close by, which makes it extremely convenient for shoppers to get white dupattas or salwars dyed to the exact shade. This is done in a couple of hours. The tailors do picoting (edging with loop stitches) on dupattas in a matter of minutes. Most salwar-kameez-dupatta sets are priced Rs. 600 plus, but if the fabric used is of superior quality and has intricate work, they can cost upwards of Rs. 1,000 per set. It is worth bargaining here especially if you are buying more than one salwar set.</p>

<h2>Jooti Stalls</h2>

<p>Since the branding was a tad questionable, we’re calling them the triad of shoe stores. Bang opposite KFC, stalls number 12, 13, and 14 are Lajpat Nagar’s hotspot for juttis, kohlapuris and other Indian inspired flats for men, women, and children. The stalls offer more or less the same in terms of design {thread work, cutout, solid colours, and embellishments}, styles, and price ranges. There does exist a certain competitive streak between the three stores, so if you’re in the mood for some theatrics, you can feign disinterest in one, to get yourself a better rate at the next one.</p>
