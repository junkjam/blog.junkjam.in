    <id>http://blog.junkjam.in/2016/04/24/gk-m-block-market-new-delhi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
Since the 1970s, the Greater Kailash M-Block Market, known locally just as &rsquo;M-block market', has attracted Delhi&rsquo;s upwardly mobile. Positioned side-by-side along a covered walking path, stall vendors flog all sort of knickknacks, making for a colorful afternoon wander.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Greater Kailash’s M Block Market is synonymous with ‘lifestyle’, with its fashion, accessories and cosmetics shops along with outlets of popular international brands.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything from groceries to fast fashion, as well as international street/sport brands such as Puma and Lacoste. But the tip for shopping here is to look beyond the immediately obvious stores to more unusual outlets, such as Tantra Boutique, a great place to snap up a new sari.</p>

<p>A two-part up market is best known for the mother of Fabindia.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
M Block is popular both with the young and the not-so-young who throng the chaat (Indian spicy fast-snack, typically sold at street corners) kiosks and the retail outlets. It has international brands like Benetton, Esprit, Reebok, Giovanni and Sisley. L’Affaire is a local favorite for a sophisticated line of Indian ethnic wear.</p>

<p>Shops that sell gold, silver and diamond ornaments including Orra and De Beers for contemporary designs and Hazoorilal and Rakyan for traditional jewelery are found here.</p>

<p>Many outlets sell western wear and accessories like bags, shoes and scarves. This market is also famous for the pavement vendors who sell tops, cardigans, track suits and other garments which are very much in tune with latest trends at affordable prices.</p>

<p>If you go out for an evening stroll around this market, chances are you will end up buying things – a pair of gloves, stockings, lingerie, cosmetics, silver trinkets, clothes for the kids</p>

<p>The lane behind the market is home to several ladies’ tailors. You can buy ready-to-wear saree blouses or get them stitched.</p>

<p>None of the hustle bustle seen in M Block is seen in the N-Block market next door. A host of retail garment stores, such as Cottons, Kilol and FabIndia do brisk business. FabIndia, Apartment 9, and Episode are niche stores.</p>

<p>The Archana Shopping Complex just opposite to the N block shopping market has some exclusive and affordable boutiques that sell Indian wear and jewelery.</p>

<h1>How to reach the Market:</h1>

<p>The market is easily accessible by local transport within the city and is located near Nehru Place, one of the well known commercial hubs in South Delhi. Most shoppers prefer to get dropped off just outside the market to avoid looking for parking in the scarce space available. You can choose to drive down, hail a cab, take the metro (Kailash colony station and take an auto rickshaw from there to the market) or take an auto rickshaw/cab from anywhere in Delhi to the market.</p>

<li>Brown Sugar Sandwiches
 For a more serious hunger pang, head to Brown Sugar and enjoy their wide range of sandwiches in various kinds of breads that, true to their tagline, are sure to get you addicted! Although they offer a variety of other snacks, desserts and coolers, sandwiches here a sure shot filling and yummy meal.</li>
<li>Prince Paan Nimbu Paani
 While you enjoy the really hot chutney that comes with these momos, grab a glass of fresh lime soda from Prince Paan Nimbu Paani (not to be confused with Prince ‘Pan’, the place known for chocolate pan). Nothing beats the heat as this pimped up version of our very own banta. The sweet-sour taste completely refreshes you in the scorching heat. They recently launched packaged version of their Nimbu Paani that lasts upto 3 months for Rs. 20 only!</li>
<li>Aunty Special Momos
 Tiny little kiosk next to Prince Pan is Aunty Special Momos. Melida, a Manipuri lady now fronts this small counter which has been here for last 13 years.</li>
<li>Mahesh Chaat Bhandar
 Ever since they made it to the Kapoor wedding, Dilliwalas love to queue up for the golgappas at this tiny shop. Waiting in the queue you may hear “the prices are astronomical” or “are all of these people really waiting for chaat??” However living in Delhi, I have come to love this place</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sarojini Nagar Market (SN Market) is one of the most coveted markets of Delhi NCR. It has been North Capital Region’s most favourable shopping destination at killer prices. Sarojini Nagar has never been a disappointment whether one has to buy shoes, trendy clothes, fashionable jewellery or designer bags. And of course, there is no use of shopping without a healthy bargain dose.
<img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14292309/359e5474-fb85-11e5-8011-526600b714bb.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14292309/359e5474-fb85-11e5-8011-526600b714bb.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="Sarojini Market" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>SN is listed as an ultimate destination for street fashion at cheap rates. There has been a wide range of high-street merchandise available, be it fashion designers, starlets, college students, school going kids, hard working professionals etc. The buyers here are not affected by the weather conditions. Even in summers, when the sun seems especially strong, all the streets of the market are bustling and being elbowed.</p>

<p>All regular shoppers had some advice that sprung from years of experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, you must withdraw enough money before entering the market as the ATMs have long queues.</li>
<li>You must remember to carry a king sized bag to stow your shopping, as carrying small polythene bags will not be handy enough and it might become a task to carry so many bags.</li>
<li>You must have the quality to bargain and never ask for price. You call out the price you want to pay and walk away if the seller does not agree to your price. Nine out of ten times the vendor will follow you and will give you the thing at your price.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="right <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14292315/3a8c39d8-fb85-11e5-8c8c-0af2e5ee19b8.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14292315/3a8c39d8-fb85-11e5-8c8c-0af2e5ee19b8.jpg</a>" width="800" height="500" title="Sarojini Bargain" ></p>

<p>Some crazy and unbelievable facts about Sarojini Nagar:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the only market where one can get the most expensive brands at one-fourth of its original price, be it Vero Moda, Lacoste, Zara, Mango or any other brand.</li>
<li>SN market is the best place to get a mind boggling variety of styles, panaches, etc. This gives you the latest trends of fashion.</li>
<li>It is the best place to check how good you are at bargaining.</li>
<li>You’ll find ample variety of shoes available all across the lanes and by-lanes of the market at astounding rates.</li>
<li>If you’re jewellery junky, then Sarojini can prove to be the most lucrative destinations.</li>
<li>The best time to shop at Sarojini is a weekday. You will not miss out on fresh stocks.</li>
<li>Wait! If you’re tired after doing all the shopping and you feel hungry, you need to worry as you’ll find great food out there in the market.</li>
</ul>
