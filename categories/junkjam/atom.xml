Everyone complains that Delhi is too costly but is it?? Really? The answer is no, it’s not!! If Delhi has luxurious Malls, best of restaurants then at the same time it also has some amazing street food and street shopping which starts from just Rs.10. So, if you are in Delhi and thinking of shopping at affordable rates, then below is a quick list of Delhi’s Best Street Markets for Girls Shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Janpath:</h2>

<p>This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!</p>

<img class="right <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>2. Sarojini Nagar Market:</h2>

<p>Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.</p>

<h2>3. Chandni Chowk:</h2>

<p>One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883036/a3765876-4adf-11e6-9615-53bc16f73f84.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883036/a3765876-4adf-11e6-9615-53bc16f73f84.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="New Market Kolkata" >
Kolkata is the city of joy, where we find many shopping markets to fulfill our shopping needs. This crowded city provides us with many markets like New Market, Gariahat market, Chandni Market etc. In this blog post, we are going to explore in detail about New Market in Kolkata. This market stands on Lindsey Street and was established as a rich arcade to fulfill the shopping requirements of the British-colonist population of the city. As soon as it was opened at the beginning of 1874, it started attracting people from all over India, who spent money in the exclusive shops of this market.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once, British departed this country, New Market had become Indianised. However, its red-brick, ornate exterior still remains British-looking. Its compact clock tower, which rises from its eastern wall, makes us remember the British Empire era.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883037/a37895a0-4adf-11e6-82f2-1f92beba48cd.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Inside of New Market you will find a shopping market named S. S. Hawg Market which looks very tangled, however it contains a grid of narrow alleys which are bisecting one another and so many shops and stalls are arranged in neat blocks. You will always find this market busy and crowded and whenever you come at this place, you will find it architecturally chaotic. The boundaries of the market are complicated for defining since it has a basement also, likewise overcrowded with retailers, whose far end seems emerging in another building which contains many more floors of shops. Additionally, of course, the vendors scatter outside the main building and sell their products on the surrounding streets also._</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883038/a378e212-4adf-11e6-9c3e-73154bdacf48.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>We need not to say that you can but absolutely everything here you want. Be it grocery item, fruit and vegetable, meat, fish, toys, toiletries, cosmetics, wigs, sandals, shoes, flowers, electric appliances, kitchen utensils, crockery, crystal, silverware, jewelry, dresses, wallets, bags, scarves, shawls, or suitcases, you can find everything in this incredible street market of Kolkata. Even, you will see astrologer, money-changer and barber shops also in this market.
Well, if you are a bag lover and you are on the search for a handbag in this market, you will get completely confused and will be spoilt for choice, as you will find a million bags on sale here in this great street market.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883039/a37d26a6-4adf-11e6-9b1d-89eca72cf309.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Entering New Market, you can see not only Indians but also the foreigners who visit this market for shopping regularly. Not only street products, you will find every brand’s outlet in this market, whether it is of dresses or of shoes.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16883040/a384da40-4adf-11e6-8ac5-53c7c00a4f02.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>New Market is not only tourist-friendly; but also the place of foodies as well. Undoubtedly, this place contains the modern shopping malls where you can find top-notch quality products anytime. In a nutshell, this is the place where you can spend your complete weekend, if you are shopaholic and foodie person.</p>

As the new academic session begins, all are busy preparing for their first day of college. Where grooming and fashion is indeed a favourite pass time for all women, Delhi University freshers, as we expect, are all busy in rumbling through their closet to choose their trendiest garments. Market places like Sarojini Nagar, Janpath, lajpat are packed these days with “fuchchas” busy increasing their range of clothes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Delhi University is a dream place for everyone and is known for its trend setting fashion statement. Be it hairstyle, dress, bag, gadgets, shoes or accessories, students will always have something to make heads turn.
Denims and dresses, skirts and shorts, classy chappals, casual flip flops, cool shades and bright bags, remain all time summer favourite for college goers.
DU campus guys, to look outstanding, people usually tattoo on their arms and forehand whereas girls probable choice is back, belly, ankle or foot.</p>

<p>2015 had a lot of fashion hits and these hits are surely coming back. Majority of the trends were inspired from runway shows. In case you’re wondering what would happen this year, just keep reading</p>

<h2>1. Off- Shoulders</h2>

<p>Last year it was really difficult to find an off shoulder dress/top. But since they are coming back this year, the market is going to be full of off-shoulder tops and dresses. They have a bohemian vibe in them. This summer I suggest you to go for off-shoulders instead of crop tops.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354473/fe04f5aa-3ab2-11e6-94e8-2d299b1c2f82.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>2. Trench Coats</h2>

<p>Definitely the best clothing item for winters. Keeps you warm and looks extremely classy. Forever 21 has one of the best trench coat stock. Instead of going for chunky sweaters, go for trench coats or over sized coats.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354475/fe068172-3ab2-11e6-863a-30eec3c18744.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>3. Bomber and biker jackets</h2>

<p>I mean just have a look at the pictures.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354474/fe0587a4-3ab2-11e6-8185-3fd9cd3894a4.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>4. Ripped Jeans</h2>

<p>When girls came across ripped jeans, they started to hate their normal boring jeans. This year too, they are going to rule. In fact, these jeans cost more than normal jeans.So, I suggest you to DIY your old jeans. It’s pretty simple!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354476/fe097b7a-3ab2-11e6-8d4a-a7fa0a7750be.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>5. Trimmed Beards</h2>

<p>I know many boys love big beards, but 2016 is not about that. Keeping it neat and classy is the key.Celebrities like Adam Levine and Liam Hemsworth often rock this look and it is sure to be a hit coming seasons.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354477/fe0ceeea-3ab2-11e6-83e1-7597fdb3fc4e.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>6. Strappy Heels and Lug Sole</h2>

<p>Strappy heels are surely sexier than normal pumps / heels. Some day if you feel your outfit is not popping,
Answer?
Strappy heels.
They are not going anywhere till a better type of heel comes into fashion.
Lug soles have this fashion blogger feel in them, making them one of the biggest trends of 2016.Plus they are very comfortable so it’s a win win for everyone.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354478/fe13cc24-3ab2-11e6-851e-79401f803c2a.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>7. Denim on Denim</h2>

<p>If you were doing the denim on denim trend in 2015, then my friend you were doing it right.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354479/fe401ad6-3ab2-11e6-8df8-4fd555c8de73.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>8. Baggy Trousers</h2>

<p>They are replacing straight-legged or skinny cuts this winter because they create a whole new silhouette.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354481/fe463c54-3ab2-11e6-8a0c-70b47450b4e3.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>9. Must Have Accessories</h2>

<p>Hoop earrings (you can wear them with literally anything!), reflector aviators /sunglasses and totes are coming back in 2016 with a bang!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354480/fe455000-3ab2-11e6-8f60-191239f3e4dc.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354480/fe455000-3ab2-11e6-8f60-191239f3e4dc.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>10. Dip DYE, Bronze and Rainbow Hair</h2>

<p>Girls, it’s time to say goodbye to your blonde streaks because 2016 is not at all about that. Dip-dye, ronze (perfect colour for brunettes) and rainbow hair are the most preferred hair colours by Hollywood celebrities. Go fun or go home.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354482/fe46bbde-3ab2-11e6-8f46-5c8362760270.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16354482/fe46bbde-3ab2-11e6-8f46-5c8362760270.jpg</a>"></p>
