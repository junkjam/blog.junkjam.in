What is the greatest highlight of Delhi shopping? Many may answer, that shopping in the cosmopolitan Delhi malls has revolutionized the shopping experience. But the hidden truth is different. Though the city malls are quite attractive but in comparison to the charm and attraction of the Delhi street markets, it’s nothing. The most convenient proof of the statement is the overcrowded; jam packed areas of the age old traditional markets of Delhi throughout the year.
One of such a traditional market is the Tibetan Market located on the western side of Janpath.  From designer clothing to stylish accessories, home décor to Tibetan artifacts, footwear to woolen clothes get it all in best quality and that too in throw back prices. Seems unbelievable? Well not, the market is one of the most preferred shopping destinations in the capital city.</p>

<h1>Historical Truths</h1>

<p><img class="right  <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/16996521/57465494-4ecf-11e6-9755-343d25be65a8.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20486720/16996521/57465494-4ecf-11e6-9755-343d25be65a8.jpg</a>">
Originally the place was designed to house in Tibetan refugees in 1960. But what initiated as a small locality dedicated to the fugitives soon got transferred into one of the popular shopping locations of the city. It is the rising fame of the market with its cheap price and quality products that it soon became a tourist spot in Delhi and became christened with the name, the Monastery market.

<h1>What remains in Offer for you?</h1>

<p>Though Tibetan market has a host of products to offer, it is known a lot for its resplendent collection of woolen garments. Mostly these are homemade winter wears and they are sold at unbelievable low prices. Shawls, jackets and designer cloaks all remain available here. Apart from winter wears, the next best thing available here is the Tibetan artifacts which includes paintings, antiques, statues, incense , wooden lamps and classical jewellery. Leather products and footwear are also quite cheap here. The small Tibetan world also holds a wide collection of exquisite Lucky charms, Tibetan bric-a-brac , Om danglers, Tibetan souvenirs and many other exclusive products. In a nutshell, it’s Little Tibet away from Tibet.

Everyone complains that Delhi is too costly but is it?? Really? The answer is no, it’s not!! If Delhi has luxurious Malls, best of restaurants then at the same time it also has some amazing street food and street shopping which starts from just Rs.10. So, if you are in Delhi and thinking of shopping at affordable rates, then below is a quick list of Delhi’s Best Street Markets for Girls Shopping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Janpath:</h2>

<p>This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888351/1738fb2a-4afd-11e6-8b4e-a1a91aef5e7e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888351/1738fb2a-4afd-11e6-8b4e-a1a91aef5e7e.jpg</a>">
<img class="right <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16888350/17375f54-4afd-11e6-9267-4718de54b7ba.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>2. Sarojini Nagar Market:</h2>

<p>Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.</p>

<h2>3. Chandni Chowk:</h2>

<p>One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.</p>

Among the important shopping areas of Delhi, Lajpat Nagar enjoys a prestigious position because of its locational advantage. A large number of people from all directions of Delhi City come for shopping at Lajpat Nagar, which offers good shopping opportunities and entertainment.</p>

<p>Lajpat Nagar is named after the freedom fighter, Lala Lajpat Rai, known as Punjab Kesari or Lion of Punjab. It is now divided into four parts. Lajpat Nagar I has car accessories and clothing stores, Lajpat Nagar II has the Central Market, local restaurants and home décor units, Lajpat Nagar III has the TDI Mall which houses the 3Cs Cineplex, and food outlets like Sagar Ratna, Chopsticks Express, McDonalds, The Street Foods of India and The Bakers Street while Lajpat Nagar IV, which houses the Amar Colony has a huge ladies.

<p>There is plenty to choose from in terms of bed linen, curtains, table cloth, bath mats, shower curtains and a number of other furnishings that bring warmth to a home. Just land up here and look around to find unique gifts for loved ones, dry fruits, tailors who will alter, stitch and dye clothes, stationery for the kids and so on. Unless there is a fixed price sign prominently displayed in the shop, you should surely bargain for better prices and deals everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a rich variety of cheaply priced curios sold on the streets as well. For instance, old and used wine and perfume bottles in the most interesting colors and shapes; ceramic pots and urns; plastic flowers and beaded curtains… it is purchase of such things in an unplanned, impulsive shopping spree that can either brighten up your day or fill your shopping bags with clutter. So be alert and use your discretion.</p>

<h1>How to Reach the Market:</h1>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490229/f269dc30-2183-11e6-96b5-db26f2d50e5d.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490229/f269dc30-2183-11e6-96b5-db26f2d50e5d.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jewellery Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>Central Market in Lajpat Nagar is a crowded market with numerous lanes, selling ready-made wear, saris, night suits, home textiles, crockery, jewellery and much more. In one of the lanes you will find costume jewellery, ranging from small earrings and jhumkas (chandelier-style danglers) to traditional wedding sets – Thses are ,ofcourse ,all replicas. The bangles are the biggest attraction here. You can get different colors and types of bangles: silver, glass, lacquer, white metal, oxidized silver and plastic. Some of them sport gold, silver, color paint and glass work in intricate patterns. You can match them with necklaces and earrings, even when they are not part of a set. The salesmen are most patient, experienced and updated on modern fashion – they even anticipate your needs. However , you have to be alert and bargain hard as well. The shopkeepers here are willing to bring down the prices substantially,so it is surely worthwhile to bargain. Choodas and kalire for the brides are also available.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Salwar Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>This lane is parallel to the front row of shops that is opposite to 3Cs Cineplex. The market is perpetually busy and sells stitched and unstitched salwar suits in all kinds of fabrics. The shops stock salwar suits made of cotton, crepe, georgette and other materials. Some have embroidery or simple patterns on them. These suits are good for regular, casual wear, while some do lend themselves to party-wear as well. The patterns are always new and change rapidly. There are tailors and dye shops very close by, which makes it extremely convenient for shoppers to get white dupattas or salwars dyed to the exact shade. This is done in a couple of hours. The tailors do picoting (edging with loop stitches) on dupattas in a matter of minutes. Most salwar-kameez-dupatta sets are priced Rs. 600 plus, but if the fabric used is of superior quality and has intricate work, they can cost upwards of Rs. 1,000 per set. It is worth bargaining here especially if you are buying more than one salwar set.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jooti Stalls</h2>

<p>Since the branding was a tad questionable, we’re calling them the triad of shoe stores. Bang opposite KFC, stalls number 12, 13, and 14 are Lajpat Nagar’s hotspot for juttis, kohlapuris and other Indian inspired flats for men, women, and children. The stalls offer more or less the same in terms of design {thread work, cutout, solid colours, and embellishments}, styles, and price ranges. There does exist a certain competitive streak between the three stores, so if you’re in the mood for some theatrics, you can feign disinterest in one, to get yourself a better rate at the next one.</p>

Since the 1970s, the Greater Kailash M-Block Market, known locally just as &rsquo;M-block market', has attracted Delhi&rsquo;s upwardly mobile. Positioned side-by-side along a covered walking path, stall vendors flog all sort of knickknacks, making for a colorful afternoon wander.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Greater Kailash’s M Block Market is synonymous with ‘lifestyle’, with its fashion, accessories and cosmetics shops along with outlets of popular international brands.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything from groceries to fast fashion, as well as international street/sport brands such as Puma and Lacoste. But the tip for shopping here is to look beyond the immediately obvious stores to more unusual outlets, such as Tantra Boutique, a great place to snap up a new sari.</p>

<p>A two-part up market is best known for the mother of Fabindia.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
M Block is popular both with the young and the not-so-young who throng the chaat (Indian spicy fast-snack, typically sold at street corners) kiosks and the retail outlets. It has international brands like Benetton, Esprit, Reebok, Giovanni and Sisley. L’Affaire is a local favorite for a sophisticated line of Indian ethnic wear.</p>

<p>Shops that sell gold, silver and diamond ornaments including Orra and De Beers for contemporary designs and Hazoorilal and Rakyan for traditional jewelery are found here.</p>

<p>Many outlets sell western wear and accessories like bags, shoes and scarves. This market is also famous for the pavement vendors who sell tops, cardigans, track suits and other garments which are very much in tune with latest trends at affordable prices.</p>

<p>If you go out for an evening stroll around this market, chances are you will end up buying things – a pair of gloves, stockings, lingerie, cosmetics, silver trinkets, clothes for the kids</p>

<p>The lane behind the market is home to several ladies’ tailors. You can buy ready-to-wear saree blouses or get them stitched.</p>

<p>None of the hustle bustle seen in M Block is seen in the N-Block market next door. A host of retail garment stores, such as Cottons, Kilol and FabIndia do brisk business. FabIndia, Apartment 9, and Episode are niche stores.</p>

<p>The Archana Shopping Complex just opposite to the N block shopping market has some exclusive and affordable boutiques that sell Indian wear and jewelery.</p>

<h1>How to reach the Market:</h1>

<p>The market is easily accessible by local transport within the city and is located near Nehru Place, one of the well known commercial hubs in South Delhi. Most shoppers prefer to get dropped off just outside the market to avoid looking for parking in the scarce space available. You can choose to drive down, hail a cab, take the metro (Kailash colony station and take an auto rickshaw from there to the market) or take an auto rickshaw/cab from anywhere in Delhi to the market.</p>

<h1>Don&rsquo;t Miss</h1>

<li>Brown Sugar Sandwiches
 For a more serious hunger pang, head to Brown Sugar and enjoy their wide range of sandwiches in various kinds of breads that, true to their tagline, are sure to get you addicted! Although they offer a variety of other snacks, desserts and coolers, sandwiches here a sure shot filling and yummy meal.</li>
<li>Prince Paan Nimbu Paani
 While you enjoy the really hot chutney that comes with these momos, grab a glass of fresh lime soda from Prince Paan Nimbu Paani (not to be confused with Prince ‘Pan’, the place known for chocolate pan). Nothing beats the heat as this pimped up version of our very own banta. The sweet-sour taste completely refreshes you in the scorching heat. They recently launched packaged version of their Nimbu Paani that lasts upto 3 months for Rs. 20 only!</li>
<li>Aunty Special Momos
 Tiny little kiosk next to Prince Pan is Aunty Special Momos. Melida, a Manipuri lady now fronts this small counter which has been here for last 13 years.</li>
<li>Mahesh Chaat Bhandar
 Ever since they made it to the Kapoor wedding, Dilliwalas love to queue up for the golgappas at this tiny shop. Waiting in the queue you may hear “the prices are astronomical” or “are all of these people really waiting for chaat??” However living in Delhi, I have come to love this place</li>
