Among the important shopping areas of Delhi, Lajpat Nagar enjoys a prestigious position because of its locational advantage. A large number of people from all directions of Delhi City come for shopping at Lajpat Nagar, which offers good shopping opportunities and entertainment.</p>

<p>Lajpat Nagar is named after the freedom fighter, Lala Lajpat Rai, known as Punjab Kesari or Lion of Punjab. It is now divided into four parts. Lajpat Nagar I has car accessories and clothing stores, Lajpat Nagar II has the Central Market, local restaurants and home décor units, Lajpat Nagar III has the TDI Mall which houses the 3Cs Cineplex, and food outlets like Sagar Ratna, Chopsticks Express, McDonalds, The Street Foods of India and The Bakers Street while Lajpat Nagar IV, which houses the Amar Colony has a huge ladies.
<img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490225/ed1d5496-2183-11e6-9da2-631446d7423f.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490225/ed1d5496-2183-11e6-9da2-631446d7423f.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<p>There is plenty to choose from in terms of bed linen, curtains, table cloth, bath mats, shower curtains and a number of other furnishings that bring warmth to a home. Just land up here and look around to find unique gifts for loved ones, dry fruits, tailors who will alter, stitch and dye clothes, stationery for the kids and so on. Unless there is a fixed price sign prominently displayed in the shop, you should surely bargain for better prices and deals everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a rich variety of cheaply priced curios sold on the streets as well. For instance, old and used wine and perfume bottles in the most interesting colors and shapes; ceramic pots and urns; plastic flowers and beaded curtains… it is purchase of such things in an unplanned, impulsive shopping spree that can either brighten up your day or fill your shopping bags with clutter. So be alert and use your discretion.</p>

<h1>How to Reach the Market:</h1>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490229/f269dc30-2183-11e6-96b5-db26f2d50e5d.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490229/f269dc30-2183-11e6-96b5-db26f2d50e5d.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jewellery Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>Central Market in Lajpat Nagar is a crowded market with numerous lanes, selling ready-made wear, saris, night suits, home textiles, crockery, jewellery and much more. In one of the lanes you will find costume jewellery, ranging from small earrings and jhumkas (chandelier-style danglers) to traditional wedding sets – Thses are ,ofcourse ,all replicas. The bangles are the biggest attraction here. You can get different colors and types of bangles: silver, glass, lacquer, white metal, oxidized silver and plastic. Some of them sport gold, silver, color paint and glass work in intricate patterns. You can match them with necklaces and earrings, even when they are not part of a set. The salesmen are most patient, experienced and updated on modern fashion – they even anticipate your needs. However , you have to be alert and bargain hard as well. The shopkeepers here are willing to bring down the prices substantially,so it is surely worthwhile to bargain. Choodas and kalire for the brides are also available.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490250/07d0609e-2184-11e6-8872-354473526920.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Salwar Lane Street Shopping</h2>

<p>This lane is parallel to the front row of shops that is opposite to 3Cs Cineplex. The market is perpetually busy and sells stitched and unstitched salwar suits in all kinds of fabrics. The shops stock salwar suits made of cotton, crepe, georgette and other materials. Some have embroidery or simple patterns on them. These suits are good for regular, casual wear, while some do lend themselves to party-wear as well. The patterns are always new and change rapidly. There are tailors and dye shops very close by, which makes it extremely convenient for shoppers to get white dupattas or salwars dyed to the exact shade. This is done in a couple of hours. The tailors do picoting (edging with loop stitches) on dupattas in a matter of minutes. Most salwar-kameez-dupatta sets are priced Rs. 600 plus, but if the fabric used is of superior quality and has intricate work, they can cost upwards of Rs. 1,000 per set. It is worth bargaining here especially if you are buying more than one salwar set.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/15490257/0e7b2154-2184-11e6-87ea-40a2f43f3c4a.png</a>" width="700" height="400"></p>

<h2>Jooti Stalls</h2>

<p>Since the branding was a tad questionable, we’re calling them the triad of shoe stores. Bang opposite KFC, stalls number 12, 13, and 14 are Lajpat Nagar’s hotspot for juttis, kohlapuris and other Indian inspired flats for men, women, and children. The stalls offer more or less the same in terms of design {thread work, cutout, solid colours, and embellishments}, styles, and price ranges. There does exist a certain competitive streak between the three stores, so if you’re in the mood for some theatrics, you can feign disinterest in one, to get yourself a better rate at the next one.</p>

    <updated>2016-04-24T16:53:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://blog.junkjam.in/2016/04/24/gk-m-block-market-new-delhi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767652/c887bd4e-0a48-11e6-9fe4-f8e319f6da79.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
Since the 1970s, the Greater Kailash M-Block Market, known locally just as &rsquo;M-block market', has attracted Delhi&rsquo;s upwardly mobile. Positioned side-by-side along a covered walking path, stall vendors flog all sort of knickknacks, making for a colorful afternoon wander.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Greater Kailash’s M Block Market is synonymous with ‘lifestyle’, with its fashion, accessories and cosmetics shops along with outlets of popular international brands.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything from groceries to fast fashion, as well as international street/sport brands such as Puma and Lacoste. But the tip for shopping here is to look beyond the immediately obvious stores to more unusual outlets, such as Tantra Boutique, a great place to snap up a new sari.</p>

<p>A two-part up market is best known for the mother of Fabindia.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/14767213/f2a38a28-0a3d-11e6-8126-1a46769bd1e2.jpg</a>" width="500" height="650" title="GK M Block Market" >
M Block is popular both with the young and the not-so-young who throng the chaat (Indian spicy fast-snack, typically sold at street corners) kiosks and the retail outlets. It has international brands like Benetton, Esprit, Reebok, Giovanni and Sisley. L’Affaire is a local favorite for a sophisticated line of Indian ethnic wear.</p>

<p>Shops that sell gold, silver and diamond ornaments including Orra and De Beers for contemporary designs and Hazoorilal and Rakyan for traditional jewelery are found here.</p>

<p>Many outlets sell western wear and accessories like bags, shoes and scarves. This market is also famous for the pavement vendors who sell tops, cardigans, track suits and other garments which are very much in tune with latest trends at affordable prices.</p>

<p>If you go out for an evening stroll around this market, chances are you will end up buying things – a pair of gloves, stockings, lingerie, cosmetics, silver trinkets, clothes for the kids</p>

<p>The lane behind the market is home to several ladies’ tailors. You can buy ready-to-wear saree blouses or get them stitched.</p>

<p>None of the hustle bustle seen in M Block is seen in the N-Block market next door. A host of retail garment stores, such as Cottons, Kilol and FabIndia do brisk business. FabIndia, Apartment 9, and Episode are niche stores.</p>

<p>The Archana Shopping Complex just opposite to the N block shopping market has some exclusive and affordable boutiques that sell Indian wear and jewelery.</p>

<h1>How to reach the Market:</h1>

<p>The market is easily accessible by local transport within the city and is located near Nehru Place, one of the well known commercial hubs in South Delhi. Most shoppers prefer to get dropped off just outside the market to avoid looking for parking in the scarce space available. You can choose to drive down, hail a cab, take the metro (Kailash colony station and take an auto rickshaw from there to the market) or take an auto rickshaw/cab from anywhere in Delhi to the market.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sarojini Nagar Market (SN Market) is one of the most coveted markets of Delhi NCR. It has been North Capital Region’s most favourable shopping destination at killer prices. Sarojini Nagar has never been a disappointment whether one has to buy shoes, trendy clothes, fashionable jewellery or designer bags. And of course, there is no use of shopping without a healthy bargain dose.

<p>SN is listed as an ultimate destination for street fashion at cheap rates. There has been a wide range of high-street merchandise available, be it fashion designers, starlets, college students, school going kids, hard working professionals etc. The buyers here are not affected by the weather conditions. Even in summers, when the sun seems especially strong, all the streets of the market are bustling and being elbowed.</p>

<p>All regular shoppers had some advice that sprung from years of experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, you must withdraw enough money before entering the market as the ATMs have long queues.</li>
<li>You must remember to carry a king sized bag to stow your shopping, as carrying small polythene bags will not be handy enough and it might become a task to carry so many bags.</li>
<li>You must have the quality to bargain and never ask for price. You call out the price you want to pay and walk away if the seller does not agree to your price. Nine out of ten times the vendor will follow you and will give you the thing at your price.</li>
</ol>
