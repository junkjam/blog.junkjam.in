There are such a variety of blouse plans and patterns out there in the business sector, yet there&rsquo;s something about full-sleve blouses or cholis that make them look so rich and tasteful. Here are some full-sleeve choli outlines to help you put forth an agreeable style expression.</p>

<h2>1.   Brocade blouse</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774633/2222c900-6572-11e6-9623-ccdadca7df61.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774633/2222c900-6572-11e6-9623-ccdadca7df61.jpg</a>" width="600" height="500">
It is surmised that brocades will be the pattern this wedding season. The brocade silk material is immaculate to make a full-sleeve choli and to make you look classy. It can run well with a lehenga or an excellent silk saree.</p>

<h2>2.   Net with weaving</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774634/2228ebbe-6572-11e6-87c8-46efcbe6d8da.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774634/2228ebbe-6572-11e6-87c8-46efcbe6d8da.jpg</a>" width="600" height="400">
Need to demonstrate some skin, yet need to go for a full-sleeve? Settle on a net blouse that has weaving on it. This looks tasteful and rich in each sense.</p>

<h2>3.  Princess cut</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774635/2230c0e6-6572-11e6-996c-8f65d880810f.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774635/2230c0e6-6572-11e6-996c-8f65d880810f.jpg</a>" width="600" height="400">
When you are wearing a full-sleeve choli, the best outline you can have is a princess cut neck. It is flexible and sophisticated. It gives a feminine touch to the outfit and shows off your slim neck.</p>

<h2>4.    High neck with heavy weaving</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774637/223b482c-6572-11e6-98f8-609c71fadaa8.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774637/223b482c-6572-11e6-98f8-609c71fadaa8.jpg</a>" width="600" height="600">
These plans are the ideal mates for the individuals who need to go light on their gems. The choli itself gets to be an adornment for this situation. While whatever is left of the blouse can be embellished with weaving, the neck is given the fundamental consideration with vast weaving and stone work. Al this makes it look like a choker neckpiece.</p>

<h2>5.   Boat Necks</h2>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774636/223a3220-6572-11e6-89ae-777e380ebd70.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774636/223a3220-6572-11e6-89ae-777e380ebd70.jpg</a>" width="370" height="260">
These necks are assuming control over the weddings since last season. Boat neck cholis are the most ideal approach to flaunt your thin neck. Simply go ahead and get yourself a choli with this outline to continue through to the end of the gathering.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h2>6.   Jacket style and cropped top style cholis</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774638/22683620-6572-11e6-8225-d4492937df5f.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774638/22683620-6572-11e6-8225-d4492937df5f.jpg</a>">

The youthful and energetic women can decide on a better time alternative with regards to choli plans. Select to wear a slick crop top.

<h2>7.   Full adorned choli</h2>

A full-sleeve plan gives an imperial princess look. Furthermore, when it is a full-decorated choli with string and stone work, nothing can beat the look.</p>

<h2>8.   Vintage and pastel cholis</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774640/227592e8-6572-11e6-9e23-45ccb347fd3b.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17774640/227592e8-6572-11e6-9e23-45ccb347fd3b.jpg</a>">

    <id>https://blog.junkjam.in/2016/08/13/dungaree-outfit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643124/c4a69736-617d-11e6-9281-0fc81faa40ee.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643124/c4a69736-617d-11e6-9281-0fc81faa40ee.jpg</a>" width="600" height="500">
Dress ‘em up, or dress ‘em down, dungarees are the new wardrobe staple. Frequently
spotted on celebrities and bloggers alike, dungarees make for a fun, chic addition to your
style. Why? They instantly amp up swag quotient, and are utterly easy to carry. With the
chills setting in slowly, now is the perfect time to lend a brand new spin to your style with
this hot fashion pick.
To help you ease into the trend, here go four stunning variants of the dungaree that you can
opt for. Buckle up, and soak in all the inspiration you can:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>The classic distressed dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643050/571a8b52-617b-11e6-88e2-0577a08b960e.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643050/571a8b52-617b-11e6-88e2-0577a08b960e.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Love distressed denims? Take them a notch higher with distressed dungarees that are the
perfect pick for a fun day out with your gal pals. Team them up with this season’s hottest
fashion favourite – cropped tees, and slip into a pair of white oxfords or sneakers to
complete the casual chic look.</p>

<h1>Dungaree shorts</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643049/56ee73dc-617b-11e6-9e46-3e9486348c04.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643049/56ee73dc-617b-11e6-9e46-3e9486348c04.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Showcase your fun side (and, those toned gams) with dungaree shorts that look playfully
flirty! Couple them with a graphic tank top and sneakers to lend just the finishing touch your
look needs. If not denim, pick a printed pair to add a dash of feminine, and swap the
sneakers for strappy sandals!</p>

<h1>Formal black dungaree</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643048/56a87468-617b-11e6-8103-d34b1c3eb0b7.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643048/56a87468-617b-11e6-8103-d34b1c3eb0b7.jpg</a>" width="600" height="600">
On your next evening out, ditch the classic cocktail dress and grab a pair of formal black
dungarees to make for some serious power dressing. Wear them over a crisp white shirt,
and a pair of pointy stiletto heels to maintain the perfect balance between formal and</p>

<h1>Layered up</h1>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643051/571b479a-617b-11e6-85e5-5679b30287a0.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/17643051/571b479a-617b-11e6-85e5-5679b30287a0.jpg</a>" width="500" height="400">
Scarves, jackets, shrugs and even overcoats – dungarees go well with each of the layers,
thereby, giving your look an all new edge. For a casual event, wrap a statement contrast
scarf around your neck and style your hair into a high-rise messy bun. For a formal event, on
the other hand, simply rest your jacket or overcoat on your shoulders and opt for pointy
heels to complete the look.</p>

<p>No longer tricky, are they? Rush now, flaunt your love for dungarees by incorporating trendy
accessories to team them up with, and leave a long-lasting impression on your onlookers.</p>

<h1>Prep your look for the season:</h1>

<h2>1. Office Casuals</h2>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893389/4b581100-4b54-11e6-9585-d4d5ae1b9a77.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893389/4b581100-4b54-11e6-9585-d4d5ae1b9a77.jpg</a>" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893392/4b5bb97c-4b54-11e6-9f06-4878565ec8cf.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893392/4b5bb97c-4b54-11e6-9f06-4878565ec8cf.jpg</a>" width="360" height="600">
When you’re an office-goer and you have the freedom to wear whatever you want, instead of a professional look you can also opt for an office-casual look. Patchwork jeans or vintage dresses can be a hit as well. We are not hinting at sweaty pants or revealing outfits but have you thought about off-shoulder tops or dresses?
<img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893391/4b590c9a-4b54-11e6-9350-b9f2c9ede222.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893391/4b590c9a-4b54-11e6-9350-b9f2c9ede222.jpg</a>">
The off-shoulder trend has fevered at an alarming pace and if you do not like to expose your arms, off-shoulders are at rescue for your arms. If you wish to wear the off-shoulder look at office you can pair the outfit with cigarette pants or pinstripe skirt, tie a bun and handle the corporate world in style.</p>

<h2>2. Party Popper</h2>

The belted dresses are perhaps, the first choice for this Pre-Fall. These belted dresses are ultra-flattering on various body types and you can pull them off easily ‘because they’re guaranteed to start a legacy with cohorts admiring your style.
<img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893394/4b8fcdca-4b54-11e6-8f12-75e18ab2d4a3.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893394/4b8fcdca-4b54-11e6-8f12-75e18ab2d4a3.jpg</a>">
Select a dress that is breeze-friendly and isn’t too sticky considering the weather and to note the style, nothing would exhibit your glowing skin like these belted dresses with a tad bit lower hemline, that’s just about it.</p>

<h2>3. The T-Shirt Look</h2>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893396/4b950038-4b54-11e6-95fb-f837eb72939b.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893396/4b950038-4b54-11e6-95fb-f837eb72939b.jpg</a>" width="360" height="600">
<img class="right <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893397/4b975324-4b54-11e6-8fd4-1e27b266d20c.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893397/4b975324-4b54-11e6-8fd4-1e27b266d20c.jpg</a>" width="360" height="600">
Its the Pre-Fall season and all we wish to do is to Baywatch or perhaps, drink margaritas and wear T-shirts, jeans or shorts but if you are in a 9 to 5 job you can’t really live this dream, can you? Me neither. If you are an office goer, T-shirts can be worn just when you get the knack to pull-off the T-Shirt look.
<img class="center <a" src="href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893395/4b93b9ee-4b54-11e6-8a96-469928486e88.jpg">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1082157/16893395/4b93b9ee-4b54-11e6-8a96-469928486e88.jpg</a>">
A cropped T-shirt with a high-waist pencil skirt is a hit. Or a plain T-shirt with a midi-skirt can do wonders for you. Why don’t you pull off this T-shirt look? Stay comfortable yet corporate.</p>

<h2>4. Shorts-in-Style</h2>

It&rsquo;s time to mix and match bright and shiny hues like lemon yellow, cherry red, emerald green as it pepper up the entire outfit and makes one look, attractive and pretty.
